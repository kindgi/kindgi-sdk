Fixes from the first Cloud Run deployment.

- **The pack service token is read the same way on both sides.** `parsePackServiceToken` (new in `@kindgi/env-schema`) drops surrounding whitespace, so a secret stored with a trailing newline no longer makes every pack call answer 401. A token with whitespace or a control character inside is refused at startup, since an HTTP header can't carry it. The Node pack service and the Python one (`kindgi.pack.serve`) both use the rule, and the pack conformance suite checks it.
- **Refusals aren't replayed.** The idempotency middleware stores a response only when the request took effect (a status below 400). A request retried with the same `Idempotency-Key` after a refusal (4xx) or a failure (5xx) runs again, so a deploy retried after trusting its key now goes through.
- **`kindgi deploy` says when an answer is a replay** (`X-Idempotent-Replay`) and how to retry: `--idempotency-key <new value>` for a replayed refusal from an older runtime. A refused signing key's hint gives the `kindgi key trust <keyId> --url <endpoint>` command on a line of its own. The retry advice for server errors and network failures is reworded.
