"@kindgi/cli": patch

`kindgi build`, a pack image's install:
- **Overrides' tarballs ship:** a `file:`/`link:` target that pnpm `overrides` (in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` or `package.json`), npm's nested `overrides`, or yarn's `resolutions` point at is in the build context. Before, a vendored package only an override named was missing in the image, and the install failed. One outside the project is refused, with what to do instead.
- **Only the pack's project, in a pnpm workspace:** the image installs `--filter '{./<pack>}...'` (the pack's project and what it depends on), and prunes with the same filtered install plus `--prod`. `pnpm prune` ignores a filter and installs the whole workspace. npm and yarn still install the whole workspace.
- **pnpm's metadata cache** is a BuildKit cache mount too, and `~/.cache` belongs to `node`. Otherwise corepack can't write its own cache beside the mount.
