Erasing a person's words: `/v1/memory/erasures` (create, get, list, export, replay), for a tenant admin only. An erasure clears, in the background, a person's (or one fact's, or one conversation's) facts, conversations, the runs that served them and what those left in provenance; facts written from them go to review. A completed erasure keeps no identifier, only a keyed hash in the ledger, which you export off-box (`kindgi memory erasures export`) and replay after restoring a backup (`kindgi memory erasures replay`). `409 legal-hold` names held facts; an `erasure-unmatchable` warning says when the deployment can't keep the hash. Clients: `memory.erasures.*` (TypeScript), `memory.create_erasure` and friends (Python). A run whose content an erasure cleared has `contentErasedAt`. An erasure whose person has a turn in a flow serving other people waits for that run (`waiting-on-run`, `waitingOn`) until a deadline (`KINDGI_ERASURE_SHARED_WAIT_MS`, 7 days by default), then cancels it; `POST /v1/memory/erasures/{erasureId}/resume` (`kindgi memory erasures resume <id> [--force]`) tries again now, and `force` stops the wait.
