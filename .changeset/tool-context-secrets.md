`ToolContext.secrets`: the secrets a tool declares in `needsSpec.secrets`, resolved by the runtime for the call's tenant, are typed on the handler's context, so a TypeScript pack tool reads `ctx.secrets?.NAME` without a cast. The `kindgi-authoring-tools` skill says how to declare and read them, and that the runtime resolves an HTTP tool's `secretRef` itself.
