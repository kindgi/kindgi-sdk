**A tool call's idempotency key.** A run's step can run more than once: resumed after an approval, retried after a failure, or run again when the runtime restarted while it ran. So a tool that changes something (a refund, an email, a payment) could do it twice, with no key to dedupe on. `ToolContext.idempotencyKey` is the same every time the same call runs, and different for every other call: pass it to the system you write to (an `Idempotency-Key` header, a client reference, a unique column), or look for it there first.

- **What it is:** a version 5 UUID (RFC 9562) under a fixed namespace (`TOOL_IDEMPOTENCY_NAMESPACE`), over the run, the step and the tool, plus the model's call id for a call a model asked for (`toolIdempotencyKey`, `@kindgi/tools`). The pack protocol schema says how, so any runtime makes the same key.
- **The step:** `NodeContext.stepScope` names a step the same every time it runs (its node, a loop body's step with its iteration, a fanout branch). A model's call id alone isn't enough: it's only unique within one of its answers, so two turns of a loop can share one.
- **Every pack language:** the pack protocol's call context carries it (protocol 2.6.0; an older pack service ignores it). Python `ctx.idempotency_key`, Java and Scala `ctx.idempotencyKey()`. The conformance suite checks that each pack service hands it to the tool, and that a 0.1.1 service still answers a call carrying it.
- **Absent** outside a run, and from a runtime that can't name its steps (before 0.1.6): the call can't be deduped on it then.
- **The docs:** "Make a side effect happen once" in Write a tool, and the tools skills (every language). `requestId` is no longer described as an idempotency key.
