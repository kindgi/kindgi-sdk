An approval says who decided it, after the decision: on the API, in the run's journal, and in the turn's provenance.

- **API.** `GET /v1/approvals/:id` and `GET /v1/approvals` carry an approval's recorded `decision` (`ApprovalDecisionRecord`): `decision`, `rationale`, `reviewerId`, `reviewerRoleAtDecision`, `decidedAt` and `decidedBy`, the decider as an actor, `user:<userId>`. An open approval, or one that ended without a decision (expired, or escalated by a timeout), has none. The TypeScript client types it (`Approval.decision`, `ApprovalDecisionRecord`), and the Python client models it.
- **Journal.** `POST /v1/approvals/:id/complete` resumes the run with `{ decided, rationale?, decidedBy, approvalId }` (`GateDecisionValue`, exported by `@kindgi/agents`), so the run's journal records who decided which approval. `readGateDecision` reads `decidedBy` and `approvalId` when they're there; a value without them still decides. Another subject's explicit `value` is resumed as given.
- **Provenance.** A tool call that waited on an approval has a `wait` node (`tool-hitl-gate-wait:<invocationId>`, the agent parked, at the time it parked) `resumed-from` a `resume` node (`tool-hitl-gate-resume:<invocationId>`, at the time the decision came; its `actor` is whoever decided, and its attributes the decision, rationale and `approvalId`). The call `waited-on` the wait, and its result was `caused-by` the resume. A resumed turn reads them from its journal, so every call shows its approval, those decided before an earlier park too. The session gate's `resume` node names whoever decided as its `actor` (the agent, for a decision recorded before it was named), with the `approvalId`.
- **Breaking, for a custom `HitlBinding`:** `ReviewDecisionRecord` requires `decidedBy`, and `getApproval` and `listApprovals` return each approval's `decision`.
