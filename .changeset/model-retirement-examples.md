Examples name models that aren't retiring. Anthropic retires `claude-haiku-4-5` on or after 2026-10-15 and Vertex AI retires `gemini-2.5-pro` and `gemini-2.5-flash` on 2026-10-20, so the `kindgi init` READMEs, the CLI README, the Gemini adapter's README and the providers and authoring-agents skills (TypeScript and Python) now use `claude-sonnet-5-5` and `gemini-3.8-flash`. The providers skill's Vertex `provider.json` registers `gemini-3.8-flash` and `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, as the `gemini` preset does, and says not to pin the retiring models. It also says what a model's `structured-output` feature means: the model can follow a JSON schema natively, while Kindgi's typed outputs use instructions, then parse, check and repair, on every provider.
