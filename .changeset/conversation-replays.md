Conversation lists leave a comparison's replay conversations out, as run lists leave out replay runs. `GET /v1/conversations` takes `replays=exclude|include|only` (default `exclude`); a replay conversation is one whose `metadata` has `replayOf`. `ListConversationsPageInput.replays` passes it to the binding (absent: include, for internal callers).

The TypeScript client's `conversations.list` and the Python client take `replays`. `kindgi conversations list` now lists, with `--status`, `--replays`, `--limit` and `--cursor` (the other `conversations` commands stay unwired).
