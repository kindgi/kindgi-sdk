The indexer carries a tool's `mutating` into `index.json`. It dropped it, so in `kindgi dev` (and anything built from the index) every pack tool counted as mutating: a dry run never ran a pack tool, and an agent's opt-in per-tool approval gates asked even before read-only ones. `pack-index.schema.json` 1.3.0 adds the optional `mutating`; the Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
