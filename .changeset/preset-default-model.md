A provider can name its **default model** (`metadata.defaultModel`, one of its models). When the router's candidates rank equally (an agent with no preference and no `preferredModel`), the provider's default comes before its other models. Without one, ties break by model name, so the "default" was whichever name sorted first: for the `openai` preset that was its flagship (`gpt-6-astra`), and for `gemini-api` a preview model.

Each preset now names a mid-priced default: `anthropic` claude-sonnet-5-5, `openai` gpt-6.1-sol, `gemini-api` and `gemini` gemini-3.8-flash, `groq` openai/gpt-oss-120b, `openrouter` anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5. `kindgi providers register --preset` marks it `(default)`; registering only some of a preset's models keeps the default only when it's among them. A runtime that predates default models drops the field, and the CLI then says what an agent that chooses no model gets instead. The API refuses a `defaultModel` that isn't one of the provider's models (400, reason `unknown-default-model`).
