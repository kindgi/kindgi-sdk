A run id that isn't one is a 400. `GET /v1/runs/not-a-uuid` (and the run's `progress`, `journal`, `stream`, `progress/stream` and `cancel`) answered `500`, from the database's uuid cast; now `400 bad-input` "`runId` must be a run id (a UUID)", before any query. A `parentRunId` filter that isn't a run id is a 400 too. And the OpenAPI `runs.list` operation declares the `scopeKind` / `scopeId` filter it already took: `ListRunsFilter.scope` in the TypeScript client and `scope_kind` / `scope_id` in the Python client list one project's runs, or every project's in an org.
