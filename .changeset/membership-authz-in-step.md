With authorization enforced, every membership change keeps the authorization store in step. `TenantHierarchyBinding` gains optional `removeTeamMember`, `updateTeamMemberRole`, `removeProjectMember` and `updateProjectMemberRole`, which change the membership row and its authorization tuple together. With an authorizer wired, `DELETE` and `PATCH /v1/{teams,projects}/{id}/memberships/{userId}` go through them. A binding without them is refused with `501 authz-membership-unsupported`, and nothing is changed. Without an authorizer, the membership bindings are used, as before.

With authorization enforced, registering or unregistering an approval reviewer (`POST /v1/approvals/reviewers`, `POST /v1/approvals/reviewers/{id}/unregister`) needs `admin` on the tenant. Reading the roster doesn't.
