`GET /v1/runs` (`runs.list`) narrows by more: `status` (one or several, repeated or comma-separated), `createdAfter` and `createdBefore` (strict), `agentVersion` (with `agentId`), and `flowId` with `flowVersion` (with `flowId`). An unknown status, a bad time, an empty value, or a version without its id is a `400 bad-input`. Both clients take `status` as one status or a list. An unfiltered tenant-wide page is also much faster on a large deployment.
