An operator can manage sign-in alone. With `identityProviderChanges: 'operator'` (the runtime's `KINDGI_AUTH_TENANT_PROVIDERS=off`), a tenant can't add, change or remove its identity providers. `POST /v1/auth/providers`, `PATCH /v1/auth/providers/{providerId}` and `POST …/unregister` answer `403 identity-providers-operator-managed`: "This deployment's operator manages sign-in (KINDGI_AUTH_TENANT_PROVIDERS=off): identity providers can't be added, changed or removed here, except with the deployment's own token (KINDGI_API_TOKEN)." The deployment's own token (the `kindgi:system` capability) still can. Reading them is the same, and the providers there keep signing people in. `GET /v1/auth/providers` says which it is: an optional `changes`, `tenant` or `operator` (absent from older servers: read it as `tenant`). The TypeScript and Python clients read the new code as forbidden. `KINDGI_AUTH_TENANT_PROVIDERS` is in the environment schema (`on` by default).
