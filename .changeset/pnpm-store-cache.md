A pnpm pack image's rebuild reuses the packages it already downloaded.

- **The bug:** the install stage's pnpm store was never the cache mount. BuildKit creates a mount's parent folders as root, so pnpm skipped `~/.local/share/pnpm` and kept its store in the layer. Every rebuild with a changed lockfile downloaded everything again.
- **The fix:** the store is a cache mount at `/home/node/.cache/pnpm-store`, under the `~/.cache` the stage gives `node`. The stage names it for pnpm explicitly (`pnpm_config_store_dir` for pnpm 11, `npm_config_store_dir` before it), in the install stage only.
