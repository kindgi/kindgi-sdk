A flow comparison can run some of the flow's agents or tools at other versions, without publishing a new flow version ("this flow, with `acme.scorer` at 0.4.0"). `POST /v1/eval-suites/{suiteId}/runs` takes `versions: { agents?, tools? }` (id → exact version) with `flowRef`. The run keeps them in `comparison.versions`, each replay runs with them, and the summary's flow `candidate` names them (`versions`).

They're checked when the run starts. An id the flow doesn't use, a version that isn't published, or an unregistered agent version is refused with `400 validation-failed`, each one under `details.issues` (for example `{ path: '/versions/agents/acme.x', message: "flow acme.f 1.2.0 doesn't use agent acme.x" }`). `versions` with `agentRef` is refused.

A run that ran some blocks at other versions says which: `versions` on `GET /v1/runs/{runId}` (`KernelRunRecord.versions`, set from `RunFlowInput.versions`; `InvokeFlowBindingInput.versions` passes them to a runtime). `@kindgi/flow` adds `overridableRefs(flow)`: every tool and agent the flow runs, including agent steps with a version of their own.

The CLI's `kindgi eval-runs start --flow=<id> --flow-version=<v> --with=<id>@<version>` (repeatable) tells agents from tools by the flow version's steps.
