"@kindgi/cli": patch
---

`kindgi dev` runs the Kindgi runtime 0.1.0 by default, pinned by digest (`quay.io/kindgi/runtime:0.1.0@sha256:…`). Docker doesn't re-pull a tag it already has, so a tag could leave you on an older runtime. When the pull is refused, the message says the image is in private preview and how to request access.
