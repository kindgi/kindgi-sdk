CLI fixes from a pilot's feedback, and the runtime's port order.

- **`kindgi runs start` never loses the run.** It starts the run in the background and follows it, rather than holding the start request open. A long agent turn no longer times out the CLI with no run id to look it up by. It still waits until the run finishes or waits on an approval, and prints the same record. A stopped wait (Ctrl+C) prints `Stopped waiting. Run <id> goes on: kindgi runs get <id>`.
- **The Gemini preset uses the models' real output limit:** 65,536 tokens for Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash, thinking included. It used to cap Pro at 8192. `kindgi providers register --preset=<name> --max-output-tokens=<n>` sets another cap.
- **`kindgi env plan --format=gcloud` emits `--update-env-vars` / `--update-secrets`.** They add or replace the names listed and leave the service's other variables alone. `--set-*` replaced the whole env.
- **`KINDGI_API_PORT`'s description states the port order.** The runtime takes the first that's set: the `--port` flag, `KINDGI_API_PORT`, the platform's `PORT` (Cloud Run, Render, Heroku and Fly set it), the config file's `port`, then 4000.
