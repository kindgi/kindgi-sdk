Under `kindgi dev`, Kindgi keeps the secrets you store in its own file, `.kindgi/secrets.env`, instead of your app's `.env.local`. A framework like Next.js or Vite loads `.env.local` into every route of your app, so a model key stored there was readable by code that never needs it.

- `kindgi secrets set … --env=local` writes `.kindgi/secrets.env`: owner-only, under the gitignored `.kindgi/`, read after your app's `.env` and `.env.local`, so its value wins. `--app` writes your app's env file instead, for a value both read, such as a webhook signing secret (`appEnvFile` on `POST /v1/secrets`; a runtime with a secrets store refuses it).
- `kindgi secrets copy [NAME…]` copies model providers' keys (or the names given) from your app's env files into `.kindgi/secrets.env`, merge-only and as written. It never edits or deletes anything in your app's files; it says, per key, that the key is still there and whether git tracks the file. `kindgi dev` gives a one-time hint when it uses a provider's key from a file your app loads.
- Under `kindgi dev`, the pack service's environment no longer holds a secret stored with `kindgi secrets` (a tool reads it from `ctx.secrets`, as in a deployment), nor any model provider's key, whichever env file holds it. `GET /v1/providers/{providerId}/check` carries the provider's `secretRef` by name, never its value, which is how `kindgi dev` knows the names.
- A command that can't read an env file says so instead of crashing: `kindgi doctor` reports the model-key check as skipped, `kindgi dev` names the file it can't read, and `kindgi providers register` asks the runtime instead.
