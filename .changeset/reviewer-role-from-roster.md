A registered reviewer can use the approvals surface with any token of theirs. The approvals routes refused every token that didn't carry a `reviewerRole` itself, so a reviewer signed in through OAuth, or calling with an API key, got 403 on `/v1/approvals`. Now a token with no role of its own takes the role the reviewer roster gives its user (`ReviewerBinding.resolveReviewerRole`), and `GET /v1/identity/whoami` reports the same role. A token with no user, or a user who isn't a reviewer, is still refused, and the 403 says how to register one (`kindgi reviewers register`).

- **For a custom `ReviewerBinding`:** implement the new optional `resolveReviewerRole({ tenantId, userId })` (the user's reviewer role in the tenant, or `null`) for its reviewers' sessions and API keys to work; without it, only a token that carries its role reviews, as before.
