"@kindgi/cli": patch
---

A Python pack has no npm project to install the CLI into, so its hints (`init`'s next steps, the `kindgi dev` banner, `providers`' secret hint) and the `.mcp.json` entries `kindgi mcp add` writes now run the published CLI through npx, within the running CLI's minor: `npx --yes @kindgi/cli@0.1 <command>`. Before, they said `kindgi …`, which fails without a global install. Node 22 is needed.
