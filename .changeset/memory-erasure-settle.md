Memory erasure: a person's unfinished runs settle before anything is cleared. An erasure has a new phase, `settle`, between `expand` and `erase`: the person's waiting turns are cancelled (reason `erased`, kept in the run's history) and it waits for one an executor holds, so nothing writes their words after a store was cleared. `MemoryErasure.settleRoundsCapped` says it went on to erase while runs kept appearing. The kernel's `RunExecutingError` (`run-executing`) is a cancel the caller asked to leave to a live executor. A replay of an erased run is refused by the runtime (`run-erased`); `EvalRunSubjectInvokeOutcome.erased` (optional) tells a comparison eval run to leave that case out and count it as `erased`, like a case erased before it was listed.
