**A project's schedules in one read, their owners named.** `GET /v1/schedules?projectId=` lists one project's schedules (a project id that isn't one is `400 bad-input`). `ListTriggersInput.projectId` is optional: the registry narrows, and the route keeps a page right from one that doesn't. Each schedule's `owner` gains an optional `displayName`, the owner's name at the time of the response: the person's display name from the directory, or the service account's name. It's absent when it can't be read (no directory, a removed account), and the id stands. The schedules router takes the directory and service-account bindings for it, and reads each owner once per response. The in-memory trigger registry narrows by project too. The client takes `projectId` on `schedules.list`; the CLI adds `kindgi schedules list --project=<id>` and an `OWNER` column.
