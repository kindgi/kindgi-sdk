A flow's agent step that runs the version its flow version holds records `via: 'flow-pin'` on its turn (`Run.agent.via`), not `explicit`: the node's `config.version`, else the version the flow version pinned when it was published. `explicit` now means only a version named on the run itself. In the TypeScript and Python clients, `via` gains the value.
