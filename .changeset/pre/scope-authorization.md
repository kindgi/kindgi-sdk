Fine-grained authorization now checks the scope a request acts on. Each route derives its scope once, with the same parser for the check and the handler.

- `/v1/env` and `/v1/secrets`: the check reads `scopeKind` + `scopeId`, the parameters the handlers use. It previously read `projectId` / `orgId` query parameters, which are not part of the API, so a request could be checked against one scope and act on another, and project-scoped callers using `scopeId` were checked against the tenant.
- `POST /v1/secrets/{name}/rotate`: the scope comes from body `scope`, else from the query; when both are present they must name the same scope (400 `scope-mismatch`), and body `envName` must match query `envName` (400 `env-name-mismatch`). The OpenAPI document now declares the optional `envName`, `scopeKind` and `scopeId` query parameters.
- `POST /v1/mcp/endpoints`: the check reads body `scopeKind` + `scopeId`, as the handler does. `RegisterMCPEndpointBody` now declares them (`scopeKind` required).
- Registry lists (`/v1/agents`, `/v1/flows`, `/v1/tools`, `/v1/guardrails`, `/v1/eval-suites`): a project filter (`scopeKind=project&scopeId=`) requires `read` on that project.
- Env and secrets routes run one authorization check per request (previously two).

`@kindgi/client`: `mcp.endpoints.register` takes a required `scope` and sends it as `scopeKind` + `scopeId`; the API has always required them, so registering through the client failed before. `not-yet-wired` reasons for `tools.manifests` and `packs.*` are reworded.
