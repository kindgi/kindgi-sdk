Publishing a policy that nothing applies is refused. `access-control`, `adapter-allowlist`, `rate-limit` and `compliance` are known policy kinds, but no runtime consumer applies them yet, so publishing one changed nothing, silently. `POST /v1/policies` now answers `400 kind-not-applied` for them, naming the kinds it does apply in `details.appliedKinds` (`model-routing`, `retention`, `tool-errors`, `hitl`). Policies of those kinds already stored stay readable, and the list still filters by them. `@kindgi/policy-contract` exports `APPLIED_POLICY_KINDS` and `isAppliedPolicyKind`; `@kindgi/api` re-exports `APPLIED_POLICY_KINDS`.
