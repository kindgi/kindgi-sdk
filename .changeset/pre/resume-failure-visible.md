**A decision whose run couldn't go on says so.**

- **`POST /v1/approvals/{id}/complete`** now reports how the inline resume went, in a new `resume` field: `{ kind: 'ok' }`, or `{ kind: 'failed', code, message }` with the run's error, e.g. `tool-version-unresolvable` when a tool version the turn started with is gone. The decision stands either way. Before, a failed resume was dropped silently.
- **`@kindgi/agents` exports `turnFailureMessage(error)`** (and `parseFailureMessage`). It writes a turn's error as a run's failure message, the form `parseFailureMessage` reads back. A runtime that ends a run from outside its turn uses it, so the run reads as that typed error.
