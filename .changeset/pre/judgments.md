Judgments and judge classes. A judgment is a yes or no, with an optional reason, about one item of a finished run's output, optionally recorded under a judge class that carries a weight. `@kindgi/api` adds `/v1/judgments` (create, list, get, unregister) and `/v1/judge-classes` (create, list, get, update, unregister), mounted when `createApp` gets a `judgmentRegistry` (`JudgmentRegistryBinding`). A judgment keeps copies of the run's input and output and of the judged item, takes who judged from the caller's token, and judging an item again as the same caller supersedes the earlier judgment. `@kindgi/authz` adds the `judge` action on `run`. `@kindgi/policy-contract` adds the `judgment` and `judge_class` retention domains. `@kindgi/client` adds `client.judgments` and `client.judgeClasses`; the Python client has the same resources. `@kindgi/cli` adds `kindgi judgments add | list | show | remove` and `kindgi judge-classes list | add | set | remove`.
