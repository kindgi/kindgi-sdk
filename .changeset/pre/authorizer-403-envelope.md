A request the authorizer denies (on the agents, flows, tools and other routes with authorization on) answers its 403 in the error envelope every other error uses: `{ error: { code: 'permission-denied', message, details: { action, resource, reason }, requestId } }`. It was a bare `{ code, action, resource, reason }`, which the TypeScript client and the CLI reported as "HTTP 403 without recognizable error envelope"; both clients now read it as a forbidden auth error. `@kindgi/authz`'s `DenyPayload` doc describes it as the denial's `details`.
