Promotions go through a gate (evals step 4b). A **gate policy** says what a promotion of an agent for a scope must show: a recent comparison of that exact version against the one live there, with enough judged evidence, metrics that reach a floor or drop no more than allowed, clean replays, and optionally a reviewer's approval.

- **`/v1/gate-policies`**: publish (`{id, version, agentId, scope, spec}`), list, get, `versions` list / get / unregister / reinstate. One policy per agent and scope (`409 gate-policy-scope-taken`, `details.heldBy`); the most specific scope with a policy applies. The `spec` is checked strictly. Writes need `admin` on the tenant.
- **`POST /v1/agents/{id}/promotions`** checks the scope's policy against the comparison named by `evalRunId`. It answers `201` (`status: 'promoted'`), `202` (`status: 'pending-approval'`, with `approvalId`: a reviewer approves it, and the version goes live if nothing changed meanwhile), or `422 gate-failed` with every check in `details.checks`. The refusal is recorded too. A promotion now carries `status`, `policy`, `checks`, `approvalId` and `resolvedAt`. With no policy for the scope, nothing changes.
- **`POST /v1/agents/{id}/promotions/check`** answers what the gate would say (`would-promote`, `needs-approval`, `gate-failed`), recording nothing. **`GET /v1/agents/{id}/gate-policy`** answers the policy that applies to a scope.
- **A comparison's summary records the candidate's `pinsDigest`**, so the gate can tell the promoted version ran exactly what was compared. A comparison recorded before this has none, and the gate asks for it to be re-run.
- The TypeScript client has `gatePolicies.*`, `agents.promotions.check` and `agents.gatePolicy.resolve`; the Python client has `gate_policies`, `agents.promotions.check` and `agents.gate_policy.resolve`. The CLI has `kindgi gate-policies list | show | versions | publish | unregister | reinstate`, `kindgi agents gate-policy` and `kindgi agents promote --check`.
