Safety fixes in model routing policy and the agent turn.

- `@kindgi/agents`: combining the bound tenant policy with a policy derived from the registry now yields a policy at least as strict as each. Allow lists (`providers.allow`, `models.allow`, `regionAllow`) intersect when both set one; they were unioned, so a registry policy could widen what the tenant allowed (for example an `eu-west-1`-only tenant also allowing `us-east-1`). Deny lists still union; caps take the smaller value.
- `@kindgi/agents`: guardrails now run on the final response before it is stored. A response that a blocking guardrail rejects is no longer written to the conversation (and no final `agent.message` event is emitted for it); the turn fails with `guardrail-violation` as before. The agent-turn flow is now version `1.1.0` (`evaluate-guardrails` → `persist-final-message`); runs parked on the `1.0.0` flow cannot be resumed.
- `@kindgi/capabilities`: a tenant allow list that is present restricts routing even when empty — `[]` allows nothing (fail closed), as a capability requirement's allow list already did. Previously an empty tenant allow list meant "no restriction".
