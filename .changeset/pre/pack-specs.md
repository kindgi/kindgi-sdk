The pack contracts are specs: `pack-index.schema.json` (the `index.json` a pack build emits) and `pack-protocol.schema.json` (pack protocol v2 — the messages, routes, headers and process contract of a pack service). `@kindgi/pack-conformance` checks any language's indexer and pack service against them, black-box, over one fixture pack; the Node pack service and the Python `kindgi` package both pass it.
