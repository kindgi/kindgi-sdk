Deleting an org is a tombstone, and `org` is a retention domain. `OrgBinding.delete` no longer erases the org: from then on `get`, `list` and `update` treat it as unknown, and its slug is free for a new org, as before; a retention policy on `org` (new in `RETENTION_DOMAINS`) purges the row. The in-memory binding tombstones too, and the conformance suite checks that a deleted org is unknown to every read, frees its slug, and can be deleted again. `DELETE /v1/orgs/{orgId}` describes what the Kindgi runtime does: the org's projects and teams stay, without an org; the org's own secrets and secret mappings are deleted with it, for good; its own environments and MCP endpoints are unregistered.
