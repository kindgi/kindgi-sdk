Kindgi inside an existing app: project-local configuration, the app's own env files, nothing leaks.

- **BREAKING — `@kindgi/env-schema`:** the runtime reads only `KINDGI_*` names. `DATABASE_URL` → `KINDGI_DATABASE_URL`, `OPENFGA_API_URL` → `KINDGI_OPENFGA_API_URL`, with no fallback; every unprefixed name belongs to the agents.
- **`@kindgi/dotenv-file`:** parses the dotenv format the way applications do (verified against `dotenv@16.3.1`), adds `${VAR}` expansion (agrees with dotenv-expand 10 and 12 where they agree) and layered reading. The writer keeps hand-written lines byte for byte and refuses values it can't write back unchanged.
- **`@kindgi/handler-runtime`:** `loadKindgiConfig` — one loader for `kindgi.config.*` (including `.mts` for CommonJS hosts) that reports a broken config's cause; `resolveDiscovery` walks only each discovery pattern's fixed prefix instead of the whole host repo.
- **`@kindgi/secrets-dotenv`:** one resolver for a pack's env files (`.env` < `.env.local`, or `dev.envFiles`). `KINDGI_*` names never resolve as secrets, dev writes go only to `.env.local`, and warnings name `file:line`, never the line itself.
- **`@kindgi/sdk`:** authoring skills updated (a handler with nothing to `await` can return `Promise.resolve`).
