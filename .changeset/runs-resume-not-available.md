**`POST /v1/runs/{runId}/resume` is not available in this release.** It now answers `422 run-resume-not-supported` and completes nothing. Every waitpoint a run can wait at belongs to an approval or to the runtime itself. A run waiting for an approval continues when a reviewer decides it, through `POST /v1/approvals/{approvalId}/complete` (`kindgi approvals complete`), which checks the reviewer and records the decision. `kindgi runs resume` says the same and is left out of `--help`.
