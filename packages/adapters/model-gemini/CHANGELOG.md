### Minor Changes

- aec851d: Gemini on Vertex AI, and providers that carry their connection settings.
  
  - `@kindgi/adapter-model-gemini` (new): a Gemini `ModelProvider` on Vertex AI, through `@google/genai`.
    - **Credentials:** Google Application Default Credentials (a `gcloud` login on a laptop, the attached service account on Cloud Run), or a service-account key.
    - **Function calling:** tool ids go over the wire unchanged; each call's thought signature is kept and sent back on the next request.
    - **Tokens:** thinking parts are left out of the text, and thinking tokens count as completion.
    - **Cost:** cached-prompt and long-context rates.
    - **For servers:** `geminiAdapterFactory` reads `adapter_config.project`, and uses `metadata.region` as the location.
  - `@kindgi/capabilities`:
    - `AdapterFactoryInput.config` (`AdapterConfig`): an adapter's flat, non-secret connection settings.
    - `ModelToolCall.signature`: an opaque token a provider attaches to a tool call and needs back when the conversation continues.
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `POST /v1/providers` takes `adapter_config`. The binding receives it as `adapterConfig` and returns it from `resolveForRuntime`; `list` and `get` never return it.
    - The OpenAPI `RegisterProviderBody` now describes the actual body, `{ metadata, adapter_id, secret_ref?, adapter_config? }`; it used to describe `ProviderMetadata`.
    - `ProviderCost` allows adapter-specific rate fields.
  - `@kindgi/client`: the generated `RegisterProviderBody` follows.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the providers skill covers Gemini on Vertex, and `adapter_config`. It also notes that the OpenAI-compat adapter isn't registered by the runtime yet.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: What a provider registration can make the server reach, for Gemini and for every provider's region.
  
  - **`metadata.region` must be one DNS label** (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; e.g. `us-central1`, `global`, `unspecified`). Anything else is `400 invalid-provider`, reason `invalid-region`. The Gemini adapter builds its hostname from the region (`https://<region>-aiplatform.googleapis.com/`), so `evil.example/x?` used to move the request to another host. With no `secret_ref`, that request carried the server's own Google credentials.
  - **The Gemini adapter** checks its target itself: the location is one DNS label, and `adapter_config.project` is a Google Cloud project id or number, since it goes into the request path. This holds for `createGeminiProvider` too, not only the factory.
  - **A Gemini `secret_ref` must be a service-account key** (`"type": "service_account"`), reduced to its key fields. Other credential types made the auth library fetch URLs the "key" named, with its headers, or read a file named in it. A key's `token_uri` or `universe_domain` could move the token exchange elsewhere. Google's own token endpoint is always used now.
