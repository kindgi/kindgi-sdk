# @kindgi/pack-conformance

## 0.1.4-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- 024a47f: **An agent's prompt and settings can come from data blocks, pinned when the agent version is published.**
  
  - **References:**
    - `instructions` is the system prompt, or a prompt block by range: `{ prompt: 'acme.intake-prompt', version: '^1.0.0' }`. Its template and declared parameters are used instead.
    - `settings: [{ id, version }]` lists settings blocks.
    - `modelSettings: { id, version }` names a model-settings block (`MODEL_SETTINGS_SCHEMA`: `temperature`, `maxOutputTokens`).
  - **Pinned at publish:** `POST /v1/agents` and deploys resolve each reference by `pickVersion` into `pins.prompts` / `pins.settings`, alongside the tools.
  - **Refusals:** a reference that matches no published version, names a block of the other kind, names model settings that aren't, or runs on a runtime with no block registry refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`).
  - **At run time:** a turn loads each block at its pinned version. A resumed turn uses the versions its `setup` journaled (`blockVersions`).
    - The prompt block renders as the instructions.
    - Settings values reach tools as `ToolContext.settings['<id>']` and templates as `settings["<id>"]`.
    - Model settings go into the model call.
    - A block that can't load fails the turn (`block-unresolvable`).
    - `InvokeAgentBindings` takes an optional `blockReader`.
  - **Changed elsewhere:** the agent spec, the pack index, both indexers (TS and Python: `Agent(instructions={...}, settings=[...], model_settings={...})`), and both clients.
  - **Pack protocol 2.4.0:** `callContext` gets optional `settings`, so pack code reads them: `ctx.settings['acme.weights']` in TS, `ctx.settings["acme.weights"]` in Python. Older pack services still answer calls that carry it: a TS one passes it to the handler, a Python one drops it.
  - **`settings` is now a reserved template name.**

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- fceb277: `kindgi dev` no longer misses a save that lands while a rebuild is running. The bundler skipped a rebuild that read the same files as the last one it reported, and told them apart by each file's size and modification time, read once the build had ended. A file saved during a build (an editor's save landing mid-build, or one caught half written, as when watching starts) was read before the save but stamped after it, so the rebuild the save triggered looked unchanged and was dropped: the dev index stayed on the stale build, a half-written file's "refresh failed" included, until the next save. A build during which an input changed (or changed within 3 s of its start, too close to tell) is now never taken for a later one.
  
  The pack conformance fixture has a new tool, `conformance.hold`: it prints `hold: <release>` on stdout and waits until the file `release` exists. The suite's drain, concurrency-cap and disconnect cases hold a call open with it, so each acts once the service has taken the call, and for exactly as long as it needs, rather than after a fixed wait. A pack service in another language implements it in its fixture pack (see `FIXTURE.md`).
- 2c185d8: Fixes from the first Cloud Run deployment.
  
  - **The pack service token is read the same way on both sides.** `parsePackServiceToken` (new in `@kindgi/env-schema`) drops surrounding whitespace, so a secret stored with a trailing newline no longer makes every pack call answer 401. A token with whitespace or a control character inside is refused at startup, since an HTTP header can't carry it. The Node pack service and the Python one (`kindgi.pack.serve`) both use the rule, and the pack conformance suite checks it.
  - **Refusals aren't replayed.** The idempotency middleware stores a response only when the request took effect (a status below 400). A request retried with the same `Idempotency-Key` after a refusal (4xx) or a failure (5xx) runs again, so a deploy retried after trusting its key now goes through.
  - **`kindgi deploy` says when an answer is a replay** (`X-Idempotent-Replay`) and how to retry: `--idempotency-key <new value>` for a replayed refusal from an older runtime. A refused signing key's hint gives the `kindgi key trust <keyId> --url <endpoint>` command on a line of its own. The retry advice for server errors and network failures is reworded.
- eac7732: A tool knows its run's project and org: `ToolContext.projectId` and `orgId` (Python: `project_id`, `org_id`), and a guardrail check's trace gets `orgId` (`org_id`) next to `projectId`. The runtime sets them from the run and its project, never from the run's input or a model's arguments, so a tool can compare an org or project id in its input with the run's own instead of trusting it. `orgId` is absent when the project has no org. They reach pack code in the call context: pack protocol 2.3.0 adds optional `projectId` and `orgId` to `callContext`. A pack service built with Kindgi 0.1.1 answers such calls as before (it checks only `v`, `tenantId` and `runId`); `@kindgi/pack-conformance` has a suite that proves it against the 0.1.1 releases (`describeCallContextCompatibility`). Also: `NodeContext.projectId` / `orgId` for the kernel, and `InvokeAgentInput.orgId` and `ResumeAgentTurnInput.orgId`, so a turn resumed after an approval keeps its org.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.

### Patch Changes

- @kindgi/specs@0.1.1

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: A pack declares the process environment its code reads, and the pack service says what's missing.
  
  - **`kindgi.config`** takes `env: { required?, optional? }`: the names the pack's code reads from `process.env`. The indexer validates them (environment variable names, no `KINDGI_*`, no name twice) and writes them, sorted, into `index.json` as `env`, which is absent when nothing is declared. A malformed declaration fails indexing as `config-invalid`. `resolvePackEnv` and `missingPackEnv` are exported for tools that check the same thing.
  - **The pack service**, with a required name unset or empty, isn't ready: `/readyz` and every call answer 503 `{ "error": "missing env", "missingEnv": [...] }`, names only. `/v1/info` always lists `missingEnv`, and the names are logged once at startup (`missing-env`). `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_CHECK=warn` serves anyway; anything other than `strict` (the default) or `warn` fails startup.
  - **`@kindgi/specs`:** `pack-index.schema.json` 1.4.0 adds the optional `env`; `pack-protocol.schema.json` 2.2.0 adds the optional `missingEnv` to `info`. The Python SDK's vendored copies match.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_CHECK` (component `pack-service`).
  - **`@kindgi/pack-conformance`:** cases for the declared env, and `unsupported` on a target, which skips the cases for a part of the contract it hasn't implemented yet.
  - **The `kindgi-authoring-tools` skill** says to declare the names a tool reads.
- aec851d: The pack contracts are specs: `pack-index.schema.json` (the `index.json` a pack build emits) and `pack-protocol.schema.json` (pack protocol v2 — the messages, routes, headers and process contract of a pack service). `@kindgi/pack-conformance` checks any language's indexer and pack service against them, black-box, over one fixture pack; the Node pack service and the Python `kindgi` package both pass it.
- aec851d: A pack's code no longer sees the pack service's token.
  
  - **Fix (`@kindgi/handler-runtime`, and the Python SDK's `kindgi.pack.serve`):** the pack service reads `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_TOKEN`, then removes it from its process environment before it loads the pack's code. Before, a tool, or any dependency it imported, could read the token. Whoever holds the token can call the pack's tools directly, without going through the runtime.
  - **`@kindgi/specs`:** `pack-protocol.schema.json` 2.1.0 adds this to the process contract, which every pack service follows. The Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
  - **`@kindgi/pack-conformance`:** a new fixture tool, `conformance.process-env`, returns the `KINDGI_` variables its process can see. The new case "pack code doesn't see the service token" checks it, in every implementation.
