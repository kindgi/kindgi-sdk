# @kindgi/pack-conformance

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: A pack declares the process environment its code reads, and the pack service says what's missing.
  
  - **`kindgi.config`** takes `env: { required?, optional? }`: the names the pack's code reads from `process.env`. The indexer validates them (environment variable names, no `KINDGI_*`, no name twice) and writes them, sorted, into `index.json` as `env`, which is absent when nothing is declared. A malformed declaration fails indexing as `config-invalid`. `resolvePackEnv` and `missingPackEnv` are exported for tools that check the same thing.
  - **The pack service**, with a required name unset or empty, isn't ready: `/readyz` and every call answer 503 `{ "error": "missing env", "missingEnv": [...] }`, names only. `/v1/info` always lists `missingEnv`, and the names are logged once at startup (`missing-env`). `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_CHECK=warn` serves anyway; anything other than `strict` (the default) or `warn` fails startup.
  - **`@kindgi/specs`:** `pack-index.schema.json` 1.4.0 adds the optional `env`; `pack-protocol.schema.json` 2.2.0 adds the optional `missingEnv` to `info`. The Python SDK's vendored copies match.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_CHECK` (component `pack-service`).
  - **`@kindgi/pack-conformance`:** cases for the declared env, and `unsupported` on a target, which skips the cases for a part of the contract it hasn't implemented yet.
  - **The `kindgi-authoring-tools` skill** says to declare the names a tool reads.
- aec851d: The pack contracts are specs: `pack-index.schema.json` (the `index.json` a pack build emits) and `pack-protocol.schema.json` (pack protocol v2 — the messages, routes, headers and process contract of a pack service). `@kindgi/pack-conformance` checks any language's indexer and pack service against them, black-box, over one fixture pack; the Node pack service and the Python `kindgi` package both pass it.
- aec851d: A pack's code no longer sees the pack service's token.
  
  - **Fix (`@kindgi/handler-runtime`, and the Python SDK's `kindgi.pack.serve`):** the pack service reads `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_TOKEN`, then removes it from its process environment before it loads the pack's code. Before, a tool, or any dependency it imported, could read the token. Whoever holds the token can call the pack's tools directly, without going through the runtime.
  - **`@kindgi/specs`:** `pack-protocol.schema.json` 2.1.0 adds this to the process contract, which every pack service follows. The Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
  - **`@kindgi/pack-conformance`:** a new fixture tool, `conformance.process-env`, returns the `KINDGI_` variables its process can see. The new case "pack code doesn't see the service token" checks it, in every implementation.
