## 0.1.5-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- 0919fe6: API keys act for a person or a service account, with that principal's grants. All of it is optional for a runtime: what it doesn't wire, it doesn't mount.
  - **Whom a key acts for:**
    - `POST /v1/tokens` takes `for` (`{kind: 'user' | 'service-account', id}`), the caller by default.
    - Only a tenant admin mints for someone else, or mints an `admin` key. A key's record and `GET /v1/identity/whoami` carry `principal`; whoami also gives a key's `tokenId`, `role` and `projectId`.
    - Anyone may list, read and revoke their own keys. A tenant admin sees every key, and `?principal=user:<id>` filters to one principal's. Someone else's key reads as `404`.
    - A token that names no principal works as before: tenant admins only, and the key is a service account of its own.
  - **A key's `role` is a ceiling.** A `member` key takes no `admin` action, even for an admin. The authorizer applies a key's limits in `filterByCan` too, so a list never shows what the key can't reach.
  - **A key's `projectId` is a limit:**
    - A request naming another project, in the path (`/projects/<id>`), the query (`projectId`, or `scopeKind=project&scopeId`) or a write body (`projectId`, `scope.projectId`), is `403 key-project-mismatch`.
    - Such a key takes no `admin` action on the tenant, an org or a team, and mints only keys limited to the same project.
    - It reaches only its project's resources (an agent, a run, a secret, …): the authorizer asks the authorization store with the new optional `AuthzCheckBinding.inProject` from `@kindgi/authz`. A store without it limits the key to the project itself.
  - **Refusals:**
    - `404 principal-not-found`: `for` names nobody.
    - `403 role-exceeds-principal`: an `admin` key for a principal who isn't a tenant admin.
  - **Service accounts** (`/v1/service-accounts`, tenant admins, with a `ServiceAccountBinding`):
    - Create one with its first grants (tenant admin, tenant member, or a role on a project); list, get, `grant`, `ungrant`, and `unregister` (a tombstone: its grants go and its keys stop working).
    - A service account isn't a tenant member unless it's granted `{kind: 'tenant-member'}`, which lets it read the tenant's settings (providers, policies, adapters, signing keys, deployments). Give it only what its job needs.
    - Errors: `404 service-account-not-found`, `409 service-account-name-taken` and `409 service-account-unregistered`.
  - **Revoking sessions:** `POST /v1/identity/users/{userId}/revoke-sessions` now needs a tenant admin, unless the caller revokes their own sessions (`403 permission-denied`). Any caller could revoke anyone's before.
  - **Add a person:** `POST /v1/identity/users` (`{displayName, primaryEmail?}`), tenant admins only. It is mounted when the identity directory implements the new optional `createUser`. The person becomes a tenant member: they can read the tenant's settings, not its projects, until they're given a role. An email another person already has is `409 identity-user-email-taken`.
  - **TypeScript client:**
    - `tokens.create({ for })`, `tokens.list({ principal })`, the new `serviceAccounts` resource, and `users.create` (it used to throw `not-yet-wired`).
    - The new error codes are classified.
  - **Python client:** `tokens.mint(for_=…)`, `service_accounts.*` and `identity.users.create`.
  - **Evidence kinds:** `api-key-minted`, `api-key-revoked`, `service-account-created`, `service-account-granted`, `service-account-ungranted`, `service-account-unregistered` and `person-added` join `EVIDENCE_KINDS` and the evidence schema. A key's secret is never in one. The stores learn who acted: `TokenRevokeInput.revokedBy`, and `by` on a service account's grant, ungrant and unregister.
  - **Retention domains `api_key` and `service_account`:** a retention policy can purge revoked and expired keys, and unregistered service accounts, after its grace.
- 1633db1: Memory facts keep their id across revisions, and every read sees only what the caller may.
  
  - **The scope guard.** A memory read gets `readers` (`MemoryReaders`): the projects, orgs, user, end user (`participantId`, new on `MemoryScope`) and conversations it may see. A binding applies them inside its query, before any limit; `isReadableBy` is the rule. On `/v1/memory`, the route works out the readers from the caller: a tenant admin reads everything; anyone else reads tenant-wide facts, the projects and orgs they may read, their own user facts, and every end user's and conversation's facts in the projects they may write. Writes are checked against the scope (`403 permission-denied`). An agent turn's retrievals see the run's project and org, the user it acts for, its conversation and that conversation's end user, never another conversation's or another end user's; `same-project` in a run without a project selects nothing.
  - **Revisions.** `POST /v1/memory/facts/{factId}/supersede` writes the fact's next revision (same id, body `{ content, expectVersion?, … }`) and returns it; `DELETE /v1/memory/facts/{factId}` closes the current one; `POST …/verify` marks it verified; `GET …/revisions` lists them; `?version=` and `?asOf=` read the past. `409 fact-changed` (with `expectVersion`) and `409 legal-hold` refuse; a runtime without delete, verify or history answers `501 memory-operation-unsupported`.
  - **Facts** carry `revisionId`, `trust`, `verifiedBy`/`verifiedAt`, `attributedTo` (from the writer), `generatedBy`, `subjects`, `validFrom`/`validUntil`/`observedAt`, `invalidatedAt`/`invalidatedBy`/`invalidationReason` and `review`, all optional.
  - `AuthzCheckBinding.listObjects` (optional) lists the objects a principal may act on.
  - `POST /v1/runs` hands the run handler the caller (`InvokeAgentBindingInput.principal`, `InvokeFlowBindingInput.principal`), so a turn knows whom it acts for: their own user facts are among what it may read.
  - Clients: `memory.facts.supersede`, `.delete` (now `DELETE`, returning the closed revision), `.verify`, `.revisions`, and `version`/`asOf` on `read`/`list`. CLI: `kindgi memory facts supersede|delete|verify|revisions`, `--revision` and `--as-of` on `get`, `--as-of` on `list`.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 2b34f78: A request the authorizer denies (on the agents, flows, tools and other routes with authorization on) answers its 403 in the error envelope every other error uses: `{ error: { code: 'permission-denied', message, details: { action, resource, reason }, requestId } }`. It was a bare `{ code, action, resource, reason }`, which the TypeScript client and the CLI reported as "HTTP 403 without recognizable error envelope"; both clients now read it as a forbidden auth error. `@kindgi/authz`'s `DenyPayload` doc describes it as the denial's `details`.
- d9cee7c: Judging a run needs `write` on the run's project, as cancelling one does: a run inherits its permissions from its project. With authorization on, judging was refused for every run, because it asked for a `judge` permission on the run itself, which no run has. The unreleased `judge` action is gone from `@kindgi/authz`.
- dde7fdb: Judgments and judge classes. A judgment is a yes or no, with an optional reason, about one item of a finished run's output, optionally recorded under a judge class that carries a weight. `@kindgi/api` adds `/v1/judgments` (create, list, get, unregister) and `/v1/judge-classes` (create, list, get, update, unregister), mounted when `createApp` gets a `judgmentRegistry` (`JudgmentRegistryBinding`). A judgment keeps copies of the run's input and output and of the judged item, takes who judged from the caller's token, and judging an item again as the same caller supersedes the earlier judgment. `@kindgi/authz` adds the `judge` action on `run`. `@kindgi/policy-contract` adds the `judgment` and `judge_class` retention domains. `@kindgi/client` adds `client.judgments` and `client.judgeClasses`; the Python client has the same resources. `@kindgi/cli` adds `kindgi judgments add | list | show | remove` and `kindgi judge-classes list | add | set | remove`.
- 2040daf: Live versions and promotions. An agent version can be made live for a scope: the tenant, an org, a project, or a segment path inside a project (an ordered list of `key:value` steps, coarse to fine, such as company then role). A run that doesn't name its version uses the live version of the most specific scope that has one, else the latest registered version, and records how its version was chosen.
  
  `@kindgi/api` adds `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live` (the version a run would use for a project and segment path, and why), `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live-versions` (every pin), `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions`, `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions[/{promotionId}]` (the history), and `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/live/rollback` and `/live/unpin`. They're mounted when `createApp` gets `agentReleases` (`AgentReleaseBindings`: a `LiveVersionBinding` and a `PromotionBinding`). Promoting, rolling back and unpinning need the new `promote` action on the agent (`@kindgi/authz`). `POST /v1/runs` takes `segments`; a run carries them (`segments`, a child run has its parent's), and a run's `agent` carries `via` (`explicit`, `conversation`, `live` or `latest`) and, for a live version, `liveScope`. `@kindgi/types` adds `LiveScope`, `ScopeSegment` and `AgentVersionVia`; `@kindgi/runtime`'s `RunAgentRef` and `@kindgi/agents`' `InvokeAgentInput` carry `via` and `liveScope`, and `InvokeAgentInput` the turn's `segments`; `RunFlowInput`, `StartRunParams` and `KernelRunRecord` carry the run's `segments`, so a flow's agent steps resolve with them after a resume too. `@kindgi/compliance` and `@kindgi/specs` list the evidence kinds `agent-promotion`, `agent-rollback`, `agent-live-unpinned` and `agent-live-pin-inactive` (a live version that was unregistered: runs use the scope above).
  
  `@kindgi/client` adds `client.agents.live` (`resolve`, `list`, `rollback`, `unpin`), `client.agents.promotions` (`create`, `list`, `get`) and `segments` on `runs.start`; an array query value now repeats its key; `agent-version-not-found` and `promotion-not-found` read as not-found, `nothing-to-roll-back` and `not-pinned` as conflicts, `scope-invalid` as an invalid request. The Python client has the same resources and errors. `@kindgi/cli` adds `kindgi agents live | live-versions | promote | rollback | unpin` and `kindgi agents promotions list | get`, and wires `kindgi agents list | get | versions | unregister`; `kindgi runs start` takes `--project` and `--segment=key:value` (repeated); `get` and `unregister` take the version as an argument (`kindgi agents unregister <agent-id> <version>`). A command's repeatable flag (`--segment=company:acme --segment=role:counsel`) keeps every value.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
