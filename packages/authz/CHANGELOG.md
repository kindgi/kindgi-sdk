# @kindgi/authz

## 0.1.4-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- d9cee7c: Judging a run needs `write` on the run's project, as cancelling one does: a run inherits its permissions from its project. With authorization on, judging was refused for every run, because it asked for a `judge` permission on the run itself, which no run has. The unreleased `judge` action is gone from `@kindgi/authz`.
- dde7fdb: Judgments and judge classes. A judgment is a yes or no, with an optional reason, about one item of a finished run's output, optionally recorded under a judge class that carries a weight. `@kindgi/api` adds `/v1/judgments` (create, list, get, unregister) and `/v1/judge-classes` (create, list, get, update, unregister), mounted when `createApp` gets a `judgmentRegistry` (`JudgmentRegistryBinding`). A judgment keeps copies of the run's input and output and of the judged item, takes who judged from the caller's token, and judging an item again as the same caller supersedes the earlier judgment. `@kindgi/authz` adds the `judge` action on `run`. `@kindgi/policy-contract` adds the `judgment` and `judge_class` retention domains. `@kindgi/client` adds `client.judgments` and `client.judgeClasses`; the Python client has the same resources. `@kindgi/cli` adds `kindgi judgments add | list | show | remove` and `kindgi judge-classes list | add | set | remove`.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
