# @kindgi/guardrails

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- afd259f: A TypeScript guardrail's config is resolved by its check's `configSchema`, as Python's guardrails do. `defineCheck`'s `evaluate` gets the schema's defaults applied (a guardrail that declares no config gets them all, so `z.number().default(1)` is 1, not `undefined`), and a config that doesn't fit is refused, naming where. The indexer checks each guardrail's `config` against its schema: a config that doesn't fit, or a required field with no default left out, is a file error, and `kindgi build` refuses the pack.

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: Guardrail checks stop when the turn does.
  
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: `EvaluationBindings.abortSignal` (optional). It fires when the caller stops waiting: the agent turn was cancelled, or ran past its wall-clock budget. The llm-judge strategy passes it to the judge's model call. A check that calls out to a model or a service should pass it on.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: the turn's abort signal reaches every guardrail check. `evaluateGate` takes it as a fifth argument. Before, a slow or stuck judge, or a pack check, held the turn past its budget.
- aec851d: The JSON Schemas now describe what the code accepts (agent 1.1.0, capability 1.1.0, flow 1.9.0, guardrail 1.1.0, pack 1.1.0). The bundled copies in `@kindgi/capabilities`, `@kindgi/flow` and `@kindgi/guardrails` match.
  
  - **BREAKING — `agent.schema.json` 1.1.0:** `tools` entries are `{ id, version }` references (`version` is an npm semver range), matching `ToolRef` and `defineAgent`. Agent JSON with bare-string tool ids — which `defineAgent` already rejected — now fails schema validation too.
  - **BREAKING — `pack.schema.json` 1.1.0:** a pack agent's `tools` use the same `{ id, version }` references (`agent.schema.json#/$defs/ToolRef`). Pack manifests with bare-string tool ids now fail validation.
  - **`capability.schema.json` 1.1.0:** new optional `kind` (default `llm-inference`), which the router already reads, and a `models` requirement (`{ models: { allow?, deny? } }`) next to `providers`. `defineCapability` validates through this schema, so it now accepts both.
  - **BREAKING — `flow.schema.json` 1.9.0:** the top-level `triggers` array is gone. No code read it — schedules, event triggers and webhooks are registered through their own APIs and name the flow they start. Flow JSON that still declares `triggers` now fails `loadFlow`.
  - **BREAKING — `guardrail.schema.json` 1.1.0:** `check` is required, as in the `Guardrail` type (`defineGuardrail` already failed without a registered check), and a `retry` action requires `maxAttempts`. `POST /v1/guardrails` rejects a spec without `check`.
  - **`guardrail.schema.json` 1.1.0 (widening, not breaking):** `kind` and `on-violation` accept any non-empty string — the built-ins are listed as `examples` — so `defineGuardrail`, `validateGuardrailSpec`, the API and the client accept adapter kinds and custom actions. `defineGuardrail` still requires a registered check of the guardrail's kind, and still checks the action's shape. The schema also allows `sandbox`, `limits`, `network` and `needsSpec`, which the type declares, with the same shapes as on tools.
  - **`@kindgi/guardrails`:** when `evaluateGuardrail` runs with `EvaluationBindings.actions` and the fired action has no registered handler, it returns the new `unknown-action` error naming the action (after the violation is recorded) instead of skipping the action silently.
  - **`@kindgi/api` / `@kindgi/client`:** the `Guardrail` wire schema and client types require `check` and `retry.maxAttempts`, and take `kind` / `on-violation` as open strings.
  - **`@kindgi/specs` README:** until the first stable release, a breaking schema change is a minor bump with a version-history note; the major-`$id` rule applies from 1.0.0.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: Messages and variable descriptions no longer point at internal components: `KINDGI_API_PORT` / `KINDGI_OPENFGA_API_URL` / `KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND` descriptions say what the runtime does; the `external` guardrail strategy's error says to register an execution strategy; the payload-version error reads "Unsupported payload version N (this reader handles version M)" — it was worded "newer than this reader" also for older versions.
- aec851d: LLM-judge guardrails route under the tenant policy.
  
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: `EvaluationBindings.tenantPolicy`. When set, the judge model is routed under it (provider / model allow and deny lists, `regionAllow`, caps), and an explicit `judgeProvider` must satisfy it too — otherwise the check fails with `judge-routing-failed`. Previously judges were routed with no tenant policy, so a tenant restricted to one region could have its run output sent to a judge model elsewhere.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: the turn passes the tenant policy it was routed under (bound policy merged with the policy registry's) to guardrail evaluation; `evaluateGate` takes it as an optional fourth argument.
- aec851d: JSON Schema descriptions (51, across 12 schemas and their bundled copies) now match the code and stay inside this repository: neutral examples (`acme.*`), no vendor names the code doesn't target, "the Kindgi runtime" instead of "the OS", no roadmap notes, and corrected claims (tool `needs` are declarative, `capability-unsatisfiable` happens at routing time, `step.cancelled` wording, SSE `eventId`). `Capability.budget` and `Guardrail.budget` are documented as declarative — not enforced by the runtime — in the schemas and the TypeScript types. Only `description` values changed; keys, types, enums and `$comment` schema versions are unchanged.
- aec851d: Tool inputs get their Zod defaults, transforms and refinements.
  
  - `@kindgi/schema`:
    - `toJSONSchema(schema, io)` and `toJSONSchemaSync(schema, converter, io)` take a required `io` (`SchemaIo`, `'input'` or `'output'`). The two sides differ exactly where Zod defaults: on the input side a `.default()` field is optional, on the output side it is required. Before, every conversion produced the output side.
    - `parseWithSchema(schema, value)` parses through a Zod schema's Standard Schema interface: defaults, transforms and refinements applied, or the issues.
  - `@kindgi/tools`:
    - A tool's advertised input schema is the input side, so a model may leave a defaulted field out.
    - `invokeTool` validates a copy of the input, filling in JSON Schema `default`s. A Zod-authored tool's input is then parsed with `inputZod`, so the handler gets its parsed input. A failed refinement is `input-validation-failed`, with the field's path.
    - A handler's input type defaults to `InferOutput` of the input schema, the parsed type.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: `runWorker`, which the pack service runs tools through, prepares the input the same way. The indexer converts tool inputs and guardrail config on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: a check's config schema converts on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: a typed agent's output schema converts on the output side, so downstream steps can rely on every field.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the tools skill explains what a handler receives.
