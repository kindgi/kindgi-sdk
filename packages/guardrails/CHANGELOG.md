### Patch Changes

- 629057d: Every model call is recorded, with everything the provider says about it, and the cost API reads it per call, per run tree, and per org.
  
  - **Usage recording.** The agent turn records each model call in a usage sink (`InvokeAgentBindings.usage`, `UsageSink` / `ModelUsageRecord` in `@kindgi/capabilities`) before the step goes on, a call that threw included. The record carries the call id, project, run, agent and version, conversation, step, provider, the model actually called, a fallback flag, status, usage, duration and finish reason; a failed call's error carries the attempts it took. llm-judge guardrails record theirs too (`EvaluationBindings.usage`, `purpose: guardrail-judge:<id>`, with the turn's step and agent version). A dry run records nothing.
  - **A sink that fails** is tried again (`recordModelUsage`; a record is idempotent by call id). An answered call it still can't record fails the step with `persistence-error` (an llm-judge's is `judge-usage-unrecorded`, which the turn fails on the same way). A failed call keeps its own failure, and says when it couldn't be recorded either.
  - **Usage, unfolded.** `UsageCounters` reports the parts of its totals: `cacheReadTokens` and `cacheWriteTokens` are parts of `promptTokens`, `reasoningTokens` of `completionTokens`. A part is there when the provider reports it, a reported 0 included, and absent when it doesn't. `ModelCallResult` adds `servedModel` (the exact version the vendor reports), `providerRequestId`, `attempts` (HTTP attempts, the SDK's own retries included, counted with `createAttemptCounter` from `@kindgi/capabilities/attempts`, a Node-only entry; a call that throws keeps its own error, and `attemptsOf(error)` gives its attempts) and `rawUsage` (the vendor's usage object as it reported it). The Anthropic, Gemini and OpenAI-compatible adapters fill them.
  - **Breaking, for a custom model adapter:** `UsageCounters.cachedTokens` is renamed `cacheReadTokens`.
  - **Breaking, for a custom `CostBinding`:** `tokens` is required on `CostAggregateGroup` and `CostAggregateResult`, and a binding that can't read should throw (the API answers 500) rather than return an empty page.
  - **Cost API (`@kindgi/api`, `@kindgi/client`).** A cost record of a model call carries `callId`, `projectId`, `rootRunId`, `parentRunId`, `agentVersion`, `flowId`, `nodeId`, `step`, `purpose`, `model`, `servedModel`, `fallback`, `status`, `usage`, `durationMs`, `finishReason`, `providerRequestId`, `attempts` and `error`, and `rawUsage` with `include=rawUsage`. New filters: `model`, `servedModel`, `rootRunId`, `includeDescendants` (with `runId`). New `groupBy` dimensions: `model`, `servedModel`, `projectId`, `orgId`, `rootRunId`, `flowId`. Every aggregate group and the total carry `tokens: {prompt, completion, cacheRead, cacheWrite, reasoning}`. A binding that fails answers 500, never an empty page. `to` is exclusive, as the binding always applied it. The TypeScript client takes `scope`, the new filters and `includeRawUsage`.
  - **`run.finished`** carries `usage: {calls, costUsd, tokens}` (`RunTreeUsage`) for the run tree, when the runtime records usage: what the ledger had recorded when the run finished, failed calls counted (a child run still running then isn't in it).
  - **Clients:** `includeDescendants` is a boolean query parameter; the Python client names a cost record's error `ModelCallError`.
  - **Provenance (breaking for readers of `model-call` attributes):** a `model-call` node keeps the call's identity (`callId`, `providerId`, `model`, `finishReason`, `step`); its `promptTokens`, `completionTokens` and `costUsd` are gone from `attributes`. A provenance read carries them in `callUsage`, by `callId`, from the cost ledger, outside the signed DAG (`ProvenanceBinding.getCallUsage`). A signed export includes `callUsage` as it stood when signed (bundle schema `1.1.0`).
- eac7732: A tool knows its run's project and org: `ToolContext.projectId` and `orgId` (Python: `project_id`, `org_id`), and a guardrail check's trace gets `orgId` (`org_id`) next to `projectId`. The runtime sets them from the run and its project, never from the run's input or a model's arguments, so a tool can compare an org or project id in its input with the run's own instead of trusting it. `orgId` is absent when the project has no org. They reach pack code in the call context: pack protocol 2.3.0 adds optional `projectId` and `orgId` to `callContext`. A pack service built with Kindgi 0.1.1 answers such calls as before (it checks only `v`, `tenantId` and `runId`); `@kindgi/pack-conformance` has a suite that proves it against the 0.1.1 releases (`describeCallContextCompatibility`). Also: `NodeContext.projectId` / `orgId` for the kernel, and `InvokeAgentInput.orgId` and `ResumeAgentTurnInput.orgId`, so a turn resumed after an approval keeps its org.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- afd259f: A TypeScript guardrail's config is resolved by its check's `configSchema`, as Python's guardrails do. `defineCheck`'s `evaluate` gets the schema's defaults applied (a guardrail that declares no config gets them all, so `z.number().default(1)` is 1, not `undefined`), and a config that doesn't fit is refused, naming where. The indexer checks each guardrail's `config` against its schema: a config that doesn't fit, or a required field with no default left out, is a file error, and `kindgi build` refuses the pack.

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: Guardrail checks stop when the turn does.
  
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: `EvaluationBindings.abortSignal` (optional). It fires when the caller stops waiting: the agent turn was cancelled, or ran past its wall-clock budget. The llm-judge strategy passes it to the judge's model call. A check that calls out to a model or a service should pass it on.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: the turn's abort signal reaches every guardrail check. `evaluateGate` takes it as a fifth argument. Before, a slow or stuck judge, or a pack check, held the turn past its budget.
- aec851d: The JSON Schemas now describe what the code accepts (agent 1.1.0, capability 1.1.0, flow 1.9.0, guardrail 1.1.0, pack 1.1.0). The bundled copies in `@kindgi/capabilities`, `@kindgi/flow` and `@kindgi/guardrails` match.
  
  - **BREAKING — `agent.schema.json` 1.1.0:** `tools` entries are `{ id, version }` references (`version` is an npm semver range), matching `ToolRef` and `defineAgent`. Agent JSON with bare-string tool ids — which `defineAgent` already rejected — now fails schema validation too.
  - **BREAKING — `pack.schema.json` 1.1.0:** a pack agent's `tools` use the same `{ id, version }` references (`agent.schema.json#/$defs/ToolRef`). Pack manifests with bare-string tool ids now fail validation.
  - **`capability.schema.json` 1.1.0:** new optional `kind` (default `llm-inference`), which the router already reads, and a `models` requirement (`{ models: { allow?, deny? } }`) next to `providers`. `defineCapability` validates through this schema, so it now accepts both.
  - **BREAKING — `flow.schema.json` 1.9.0:** the top-level `triggers` array is gone. No code read it — schedules, event triggers and webhooks are registered through their own APIs and name the flow they start. Flow JSON that still declares `triggers` now fails `loadFlow`.
  - **BREAKING — `guardrail.schema.json` 1.1.0:** `check` is required, as in the `Guardrail` type (`defineGuardrail` already failed without a registered check), and a `retry` action requires `maxAttempts`. `POST /v1/guardrails` rejects a spec without `check`.
  - **`guardrail.schema.json` 1.1.0 (widening, not breaking):** `kind` and `on-violation` accept any non-empty string — the built-ins are listed as `examples` — so `defineGuardrail`, `validateGuardrailSpec`, the API and the client accept adapter kinds and custom actions. `defineGuardrail` still requires a registered check of the guardrail's kind, and still checks the action's shape. The schema also allows `sandbox`, `limits`, `network` and `needsSpec`, which the type declares, with the same shapes as on tools.
  - **`@kindgi/guardrails`:** when `evaluateGuardrail` runs with `EvaluationBindings.actions` and the fired action has no registered handler, it returns the new `unknown-action` error naming the action (after the violation is recorded) instead of skipping the action silently.
  - **`@kindgi/api` / `@kindgi/client`:** the `Guardrail` wire schema and client types require `check` and `retry.maxAttempts`, and take `kind` / `on-violation` as open strings.
  - **`@kindgi/specs` README:** until the first stable release, a breaking schema change is a minor bump with a version-history note; the major-`$id` rule applies from 1.0.0.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: Messages and variable descriptions no longer point at internal components: `KINDGI_API_PORT` / `KINDGI_OPENFGA_API_URL` / `KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND` descriptions say what the runtime does; the `external` guardrail strategy's error says to register an execution strategy; the payload-version error reads "Unsupported payload version N (this reader handles version M)" — it was worded "newer than this reader" also for older versions.
- aec851d: LLM-judge guardrails route under the tenant policy.
  
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: `EvaluationBindings.tenantPolicy`. When set, the judge model is routed under it (provider / model allow and deny lists, `regionAllow`, caps), and an explicit `judgeProvider` must satisfy it too — otherwise the check fails with `judge-routing-failed`. Previously judges were routed with no tenant policy, so a tenant restricted to one region could have its run output sent to a judge model elsewhere.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: the turn passes the tenant policy it was routed under (bound policy merged with the policy registry's) to guardrail evaluation; `evaluateGate` takes it as an optional fourth argument.
- aec851d: JSON Schema descriptions (51, across 12 schemas and their bundled copies) now match the code and stay inside this repository: neutral examples (`acme.*`), no vendor names the code doesn't target, "the Kindgi runtime" instead of "the OS", no roadmap notes, and corrected claims (tool `needs` are declarative, `capability-unsatisfiable` happens at routing time, `step.cancelled` wording, SSE `eventId`). `Capability.budget` and `Guardrail.budget` are documented as declarative — not enforced by the runtime — in the schemas and the TypeScript types. Only `description` values changed; keys, types, enums and `$comment` schema versions are unchanged.
- aec851d: Tool inputs get their Zod defaults, transforms and refinements.
  
  - `@kindgi/schema`:
    - `toJSONSchema(schema, io)` and `toJSONSchemaSync(schema, converter, io)` take a required `io` (`SchemaIo`, `'input'` or `'output'`). The two sides differ exactly where Zod defaults: on the input side a `.default()` field is optional, on the output side it is required. Before, every conversion produced the output side.
    - `parseWithSchema(schema, value)` parses through a Zod schema's Standard Schema interface: defaults, transforms and refinements applied, or the issues.
  - `@kindgi/tools`:
    - A tool's advertised input schema is the input side, so a model may leave a defaulted field out.
    - `invokeTool` validates a copy of the input, filling in JSON Schema `default`s. A Zod-authored tool's input is then parsed with `inputZod`, so the handler gets its parsed input. A failed refinement is `input-validation-failed`, with the field's path.
    - A handler's input type defaults to `InferOutput` of the input schema, the parsed type.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: `runWorker`, which the pack service runs tools through, prepares the input the same way. The indexer converts tool inputs and guardrail config on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: a check's config schema converts on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: a typed agent's output schema converts on the output side, so downstream steps can rely on every field.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the tools skill explains what a handler receives.
