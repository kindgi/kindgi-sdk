# @kindgi/api

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 2544717: An approval says who decided it, after the decision: on the API, in the run's journal, and in the turn's provenance.
  
  - **API.** `GET /v1/approvals/:id` and `GET /v1/approvals` carry an approval's recorded `decision` (`ApprovalDecisionRecord`): `decision`, `rationale`, `reviewerId`, `reviewerRoleAtDecision`, `decidedAt` and `decidedBy`, the decider as an actor, `user:<userId>`. An open approval, or one that ended without a decision (expired, or escalated by a timeout), has none. The TypeScript client types it (`Approval.decision`, `ApprovalDecisionRecord`), and the Python client models it.
  - **Journal.** `POST /v1/approvals/:id/complete` resumes the run with `{ decided, rationale?, decidedBy, approvalId }` (`GateDecisionValue`, exported by `@kindgi/agents`), so the run's journal records who decided which approval. `readGateDecision` reads `decidedBy` and `approvalId` when they're there; a value without them still decides. Another subject's explicit `value` is resumed as given.
  - **Provenance.** A tool call that waited on an approval has a `wait` node (`tool-hitl-gate-wait:<invocationId>`, the agent parked, at the time it parked) `resumed-from` a `resume` node (`tool-hitl-gate-resume:<invocationId>`, at the time the decision came; its `actor` is whoever decided, and its attributes the decision, rationale and `approvalId`). The call `waited-on` the wait, and its result was `caused-by` the resume. A resumed turn reads them from its journal, so every call shows its approval, those decided before an earlier park too. The session gate's `resume` node names whoever decided as its `actor` (the agent, for a decision recorded before it was named), with the `approvalId`.
  - **For a custom `HitlBinding`:** return each approval's `decision` from `getApproval` and `listApprovals`, with `ReviewDecisionRecord.decidedBy`, for them to show; both are optional, and a binding without them answers as before.
- 0f226c2: An agent's approval gates fail closed. A tool-call approval rejected with a `value` still ran the tool: `POST /v1/approvals/:id/complete` let a `value` replace the resume payload `{ decided, rationale }`, and the tool and session gates went on unless they read an explicit `reject`. Now only an explicit approve lets a tool run or a session go on; a reject, or an answer that isn't a decision at all, blocks, the tool call with a rejected result that says why. And the route refuses a `value` for an agent's tool-call or session gate (`tool-call:pending`, `agent-turn:session-hitl-gate`) with `400 bad-input`, before anything is recorded; another subject's approval still takes one. `@kindgi/agents` exports the gate subjects (`AGENT_GATE_SUBJECTS`, `TOOL_CALL_GATE_SUBJECT`, `SESSION_GATE_SUBJECT`) and `readGateDecision`.
- 629057d: Every model call is recorded, with everything the provider says about it, and the cost API reads it per call, per run tree, and per org.
  
  - **Usage recording.** The agent turn records each model call in a usage sink (`InvokeAgentBindings.usage`, `UsageSink` / `ModelUsageRecord` in `@kindgi/capabilities`) before the step goes on, a call that threw included. The record carries the call id, project, run, agent and version, conversation, step, provider, the model actually called, a fallback flag, status, usage, duration and finish reason; a failed call's error carries the attempts it took. llm-judge guardrails record theirs too (`EvaluationBindings.usage`, `purpose: guardrail-judge:<id>`, with the turn's step and agent version). A dry run records nothing.
  - **A sink that fails** is tried again (`recordModelUsage`; a record is idempotent by call id). An answered call it still can't record fails the step with `persistence-error` (an llm-judge's is `judge-usage-unrecorded`, which the turn fails on the same way). A failed call keeps its own failure, and says when it couldn't be recorded either.
  - **Usage, unfolded.** `UsageCounters` reports the parts of its totals: `cacheReadTokens` and `cacheWriteTokens` are parts of `promptTokens`, `reasoningTokens` of `completionTokens`. A part is there when the provider reports it, a reported 0 included, and absent when it doesn't. `ModelCallResult` adds `servedModel` (the exact version the vendor reports), `providerRequestId`, `attempts` (HTTP attempts, the SDK's own retries included, counted with `createAttemptCounter` from `@kindgi/capabilities/attempts`, a Node-only entry; a call that throws keeps its own error, and `attemptsOf(error)` gives its attempts) and `rawUsage` (the vendor's usage object as it reported it). The Anthropic, Gemini and OpenAI-compatible adapters fill them.
  - **Breaking, for a custom model adapter:** `UsageCounters.cachedTokens` is renamed `cacheReadTokens`.
  - **Breaking, for a custom `CostBinding`:** `tokens` is required on `CostAggregateGroup` and `CostAggregateResult`, and a binding that can't read should throw (the API answers 500) rather than return an empty page.
  - **Cost API (`@kindgi/api`, `@kindgi/client`).** A cost record of a model call carries `callId`, `projectId`, `rootRunId`, `parentRunId`, `agentVersion`, `flowId`, `nodeId`, `step`, `purpose`, `model`, `servedModel`, `fallback`, `status`, `usage`, `durationMs`, `finishReason`, `providerRequestId`, `attempts` and `error`, and `rawUsage` with `include=rawUsage`. New filters: `model`, `servedModel`, `rootRunId`, `includeDescendants` (with `runId`). New `groupBy` dimensions: `model`, `servedModel`, `projectId`, `orgId`, `rootRunId`, `flowId`. Every aggregate group and the total carry `tokens: {prompt, completion, cacheRead, cacheWrite, reasoning}`. A binding that fails answers 500, never an empty page. `to` is exclusive, as the binding always applied it. The TypeScript client takes `scope`, the new filters and `includeRawUsage`.
  - **`run.finished`** carries `usage: {calls, costUsd, tokens}` (`RunTreeUsage`) for the run tree, when the runtime records usage: what the ledger had recorded when the run finished, failed calls counted (a child run still running then isn't in it).
  - **Clients:** `includeDescendants` is a boolean query parameter; the Python client names a cost record's error `ModelCallError`.
  - **Provenance (breaking for readers of `model-call` attributes):** a `model-call` node keeps the call's identity (`callId`, `providerId`, `model`, `finishReason`, `step`); its `promptTokens`, `completionTokens` and `costUsd` are gone from `attributes`. A provenance read carries them in `callUsage`, by `callId`, from the cost ledger, outside the signed DAG (`ProvenanceBinding.getCallUsage`). A signed export includes `callUsage` as it stood when signed (bundle schema `1.1.0`).
- 1463b77: Approvals, conversations and provenance list by project, as runs do. `GET /v1/approvals`, `GET /v1/conversations` and `GET /v1/provenance` take `scopeKind=project|org` + `scopeId`: one project's records, or every project's in an org. A `scopeId` that isn't a UUID is `400 scope-invalid`. The records say their project:
  - an agent's approvals are enqueued in the turn's project (`HitlEnqueueInput.projectId`);
  - a conversation has `projectId`, set by the run that opens it or by `POST /v1/conversations`' new `projectId` (one of the tenant's projects, else `400 bad-input`; omitted, the tenant's Default project, as for a run); `agent_conversations` gets a nullable `project_id` (migration `0003`);
  - a provenance record's list row has `projectId`, which the emitter passes beside the signed document (`ProvenanceEmitBinding.emit(provenance, { projectId })`).
  
  `ListScope` (`@kindgi/types`) is the scope of each binding's list input. TypeScript client: `scope` on `approvals.list`, `conversations.list` and `provenance.query`, and `projectId` on `conversations.open`; the Python client takes `scope_kind` / `scope_id` and `project_id` (regenerated). Records from before this release have no project, so only a list without a scope shows them (nothing is backfilled).
- 453056f: A registered reviewer can use the approvals surface with any token of theirs. The approvals routes refused every token that didn't carry a `reviewerRole` itself, so a reviewer signed in through OAuth, or calling with an API key, got 403 on `/v1/approvals`. Now a token with no role of its own takes the role the reviewer roster gives its user (`ReviewerBinding.resolveReviewerRole`), and `GET /v1/identity/whoami` reports the same role. A token with no user, or a user who isn't a reviewer, is still refused, and the 403 says how to register one (`kindgi reviewers register`).
  
  - **For a custom `ReviewerBinding`:** implement the new optional `resolveReviewerRole({ tenantId, userId })` (the user's reviewer role in the tenant, or `null`) for its reviewers' sessions and API keys to work; without it, only a token that carries its role reviews, as before.
- 6bae409: An agent's turn names its agent. The run record of an agent run, and of the turn a flow's agent step starts, carries `agent`: the agent's id, the version that ran and the conversation (`RunAgentRef` in `@kindgi/runtime`, `Run.agent` on the wire, the `RunAgent` schema). `GET /v1/runs?agentId=` lists one agent's turns, at every version; it combines with the scope, `topLevel` and the cursor. The TypeScript client takes `runs.list({ agentId })`; the Python client `runs.list(agent_id=…)`. Turns that ran before this release don't name their agent: they have no `agent` and aren't listed by `agentId`.
- ab23a9b: A run id that isn't one is a 400. `GET /v1/runs/not-a-uuid` (and the run's `progress`, `journal`, `stream`, `progress/stream` and `cancel`) answered `500`, from the database's uuid cast; now `400 bad-input` "`runId` must be a run id (a UUID)", before any query. A `parentRunId` filter that isn't a run id is a 400 too. And the OpenAPI `runs.list` operation declares the `scopeKind` / `scopeId` filter it already took: `ListRunsFilter.scope` in the TypeScript client and `scope_kind` / `scope_id` in the Python client list one project's runs, or every project's in an org. The TypeScript client's scopes (runs, cost, env, secrets, MCP endpoints) take a `ScopeRef`: `{ kind: 'project', projectId }` or `{ kind: 'org', orgId }`, with no `tenantId` needed (the API takes the tenant from the token; a `Scope` with one still fits).
- 6c274dd: `GET /v1/runs?scopeKind=project|org&scopeId=…` with a `scopeId` that isn't a UUID is `400 scope-invalid` ("scope query parameters malformed: scopeId must be a project id (a UUID), got …"), before any query; it reached the database's uuid cast and failed there. The runs list now reads its scope as approvals, conversations and provenance do.
- 2c185d8: Fixes from the first Cloud Run deployment.
  
  - **The pack service token is read the same way on both sides.** `parsePackServiceToken` (new in `@kindgi/env-schema`) drops surrounding whitespace, so a secret stored with a trailing newline no longer makes every pack call answer 401. A token with whitespace or a control character inside is refused at startup, since an HTTP header can't carry it. The Node pack service and the Python one (`kindgi.pack.serve`) both use the rule, and the pack conformance suite checks it.
  - **Refusals aren't replayed.** The idempotency middleware stores a response only when the request took effect (a status below 400). A request retried with the same `Idempotency-Key` after a refusal (4xx) or a failure (5xx) runs again, so a deploy retried after trusting its key now goes through.
  - **`kindgi deploy` says when an answer is a replay** (`X-Idempotent-Replay`) and how to retry: `--idempotency-key <new value>` for a replayed refusal from an older runtime. A refused signing key's hint gives the `kindgi key trust <keyId> --url <endpoint>` command on a line of its own. The retry advice for server errors and network failures is reworded.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- 610a9de: `@kindgi/agents` uses drizzle-orm 0.45.3, which fixes how SQL identifiers are escaped (GHSA-gpj5-g38j-94v9). Kindgi's schema uses fixed identifiers only, so it wasn't exploitable through Kindgi. `@kindgi/api` no longer depends on drizzle-orm, which it never used.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 786ea98: An exception a route throws now reaches the client as a `500 internal-server-error` wire error, as JSON with its message and the request id. Before, Hono's own error handler answered first with plain-text "Internal Server Error", so the JSON error mapper never ran and clients got an unparseable 500. The mapping is now the app's error handler (`app.onError`); an exception that carries its own response (Hono's `HTTPException`) still answers with it.
- 324aba4: **`POST /v1/runs/{runId}/resume` is not available in this release.** It now answers `422 run-resume-not-supported` and completes nothing. Every waitpoint a run can wait at belongs to an approval or to the runtime itself. A run waiting for an approval continues when a reviewer decides it, through `POST /v1/approvals/{approvalId}/complete` (`kindgi approvals complete`), which checks the reviewer and records the decision. `kindgi runs resume` says the same and is left out of `--help`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: API keys are service accounts with a role and capabilities, and they can be listed.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:**
    - `POST /v1/tokens` takes `role` (`admin` | `member`, default `member`) and `capabilities`.
      - Only a tenant admin can mint (`admin` on the tenant with authorization on, otherwise the `tenant-admin` scope), and only capabilities the caller holds can be granted.
      - The response is the key's record plus its `token`, shown once.
    - New `GET /v1/tokens` (paged, newest first) and `GET /v1/tokens/{tokenId}`. They're tenant-admin only and never return secrets. Revoke is tenant-admin only too.
    - `TokenAdmin` gains `list` and `get`. `mint` takes `role`, `capabilities` and `createdBy`, and returns `{ record, token }`. New types: `ApiTokenRecord`, `ApiTokenRole`, `API_TOKEN_ROLES`.
    - `TokenResolution.tokenId` is a durable key's id. The principal is then `service_account:<tokenId>`, and it wins over a session id.
  - **`@kindgi/client`:**
    - `tokens.create(spec?)` sends `role`, `capabilities`, `label`, `expiresAt` and `projectId`, and returns the server's record. `ApiTokenSpec` and `ApiToken` drop `name`/`scopes` for `label`/`role`/`capabilities`.
    - `tokens.list({ limit, cursor })` and `tokens.get(id)` are wired.
    - The unwired `tokens.scopes()` and `TokenScope` are gone.
- aec851d: A deployment's tools and guardrails keep where their code is, and the trust list it's verified against gets routes.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`, `POST /v1/deployments`:**
    - **What registers is the signed image's index.** The server reads `/app/index.json` from the image, checks it hashes to the signed `indexHash`, and registers what it declares. The request body no longer carries `index`. Before, the route validated and registered the body's copy, which no signature covers, so a replayed request could register tools the image never shipped. The image's index must also name the signed `artifactVersion` (`400 image-unverifiable` otherwise).
    - **The code pointer.** A tool's `modulePath` and a guardrail's `checkModulePath` become `codeArtifactRef: { kind: 'oci', imageRef, modulePath, artifactVersion }`, pointing into the deployed image. Before, they were stripped, so a deployed pack tool had no code the runtime could reach.
    - **What a deployment shipped.** The record gains `contents`: each tool's, agent's and flow's `{ id, version }`, and each guardrail's `{ id }`. `DeploymentRegisterInput` and `Deployment` carry it; it's required, so a `DeploymentBinding` stores it. Versions are immutable and a digest deploys once, so the latest deployment is the live one. A rollback rolls forward: deploy the earlier code again under new versions.
    - **The catalog caches hear of it.** A new deployment calls `onToolWrite` / `onGuardrailWrite` for each tool and guardrail it registered, as `POST /v1/tools` and `POST /v1/guardrails` do, so a runtime's tool and guardrail bridges see it at once. `DeploymentContents` and `DeployedPrimitive` are exported.
    - **Indexed guardrails deploy.** A guardrail's `checkId` becomes its `check`, and the index-only `configSchema` is dropped, as `kindgi dev` maps them. Before, every guardrail the indexer writes failed validation.
  - **`@kindgi/api`, `/v1/signing-keys`:** the tenant's trusted signing keys, the public keys whose deployments verify. Mounted when `signingKeyRegistry` is passed, on its own, without the deployments route.
    - `POST /v1/signing-keys` trusts a key: `keyId`, `publicKey` (base64 Ed25519), `label?`. It returns `201`, or `200` for the same key again. A known id with another key is `409 signing-key-conflict`; rotate under a new id.
    - `GET /v1/signing-keys` lists the active keys (`?includeRevoked=true`, `?label=` prefix). `GET /v1/signing-keys/{keyId}` returns one key, revoked or not.
    - `POST /v1/signing-keys/{keyId}/revoke` takes an optional `reason`. A revoked key stays readable for audit and verifies no new deployments.
    - Writes need the `signing-keys:write` capability.
    - Revocation is final: trusting a revoked key id again is `409 signing-key-revoked`.
    - New error codes: `signing-key-conflict` (409), `signing-key-revoked` (409), `signing-key-algorithm-unsupported` (400), `signing-key-store-error` (500).
  - **`@kindgi/client`:** `client.signingKeys` (`trust`, `list`, `get`, `revoke`); `deployments.register` takes no `index`. The Python client's models and resources follow.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** the `image-registry` group, how the server reads deployment images: `KINDGI_IMAGE_REGISTRY_HOST`, `_USERNAME`, `_PASSWORD` (credentials for one host, all three or none) and `_INSECURE_HOSTS` (hosts reached over plain HTTP).
- aec851d: The hooks the runtime needs to guard the server's connections to hosts a tenant chose (T83). The guard itself is in the runtime.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:** `HostReach` gains `'metadata-network'` (link-local addresses, where the cloud metadata endpoints hand out the server's credentials) and `'loopback'` (the server's own host). `KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS=deployed` refuses both, as well as `'exec'`.
  - **`@kindgi/capabilities`:** `AdapterFactoryInput.fetch` is the fetch for a provider endpoint the registration chose.
  - **`@kindgi/adapter-model-openai-compat`:** the factory sends through that fetch.
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:**
    - `defineTool(spec, { synthesizer: { fetch } })` and `ToolSpecSynthesizerOptions`: a declarative HTTP tool's handler sends through the runtime's fetch.
    - `validateToolManifest` now refuses an HTTP tool whose `urlTemplate` puts a `{placeholder}` in the scheme, host or port, or isn't `http(s)://` with a host. Placeholders belong in the path and query, where they're URL-encoded; in the authority, a run's input would pick the host.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS`'s description says what `deployed` refuses.
- aec851d: What a tenant registers can no longer reach the server's own host unless the deployment allows it, and MCP endpoints authenticate through the secrets store.
  
  - **`KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS`** (`@kindgi/env-schema`): `deployed` refuses a `stdio` MCP endpoint, a command the server would run in its container as its user. `local` allows it, for a machine where every token holder may run commands. Unset, it's `local` under `KINDGI_DEV` and `deployed` otherwise.
  - **`@kindgi/api`:**
    - `createApp` takes `tenantHostAccess` (default `deployed`). Under `deployed`, registering a `stdio` endpoint answers `403 host-access-denied`, a new error code.
    - `deniesHostReach`, `parseTenantHostAccess`, `TENANT_HOST_ACCESS_LEVELS` and `stdioRefusal` are exported for the runtime's connect-time check. Checks ask `deniesHostReach(level, reach)`, so a stricter level is one more row.
    - `mcpRouter` takes the level as a fourth argument.
  - **`MCPEndpoint.secretRef: { envName, name }` replaces `authRef`.** It's a secret by name in the deployment's store, resolved at the endpoint's tenant scope, the shape webhooks and providers use.
    - `env:NAME` references, which read the server's own environment, are gone.
    - The register body now refuses unknown fields, so an `authRef` is a `400` (`unknown-field`), not silently dropped.
    - The webhook routes and MCP share one `secretRef` parser.
  - **`@kindgi/client`:** `McpEndpoint` and `RegisterMcpEndpointInput` take `secretRef` (`McpEndpointSecretRef`). The Python `kindgi.client` is regenerated: `secret_ref` replaces `auth_ref`.
- aec851d: A tool reads back the way it was registered: the wire shape carries the whole manifest.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:**
    - `GET /v1/tools`, `GET /v1/tools/{toolId}` and the versions routes now return `mutating`, `sandbox`, `limits`, `network`, `needsSpec`, `codeArtifactRef` (where the code runs: the deployed image and module) and the declarative `spec`. Before, they dropped them, so nothing reading the API could see where a pack tool's code runs or how it's sandboxed. A secret appears only as a reference (`secretRef`), never a value.
    - The `Tool` schema (and `RegisterToolBody`, `ToolVersionRow`) declares those fields. They were accepted and stored already, but undocumented, so a typed client couldn't send them without a cast.
    - New components: `SandboxMode`, `RuntimeLimits`, `NetworkPolicy`, `TypedNeeds`, `CodeArtifactRef`, `ToolSpec`, and the declarative HTTP tool's `HttpToolSpec`, `HttpHeaderSpec`, `HttpAuthSpec`, `HttpRequestBodySpec`, `ToolSecretRef`. Each is a mirror of `@kindgi/specs/tool.schema.json`. The schema drift test now holds Tool's property names, and each of these, equal to the spec.
  - **`@kindgi/client`:** the tool types gain the fields. The Python client's models follow.
- aec851d: Gemini on Vertex AI, and providers that carry their connection settings.
  
  - `@kindgi/adapter-model-gemini` (new): a Gemini `ModelProvider` on Vertex AI, through `@google/genai`.
    - **Credentials:** Google Application Default Credentials (a `gcloud` login on a laptop, the attached service account on Cloud Run), or a service-account key.
    - **Function calling:** tool ids go over the wire unchanged; each call's thought signature is kept and sent back on the next request.
    - **Tokens:** thinking parts are left out of the text, and thinking tokens count as completion.
    - **Cost:** cached-prompt and long-context rates.
    - **For servers:** `geminiAdapterFactory` reads `adapter_config.project`, and uses `metadata.region` as the location.
  - `@kindgi/capabilities`:
    - `AdapterFactoryInput.config` (`AdapterConfig`): an adapter's flat, non-secret connection settings.
    - `ModelToolCall.signature`: an opaque token a provider attaches to a tool call and needs back when the conversation continues.
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `POST /v1/providers` takes `adapter_config`. The binding receives it as `adapterConfig` and returns it from `resolveForRuntime`; `list` and `get` never return it.
    - The OpenAPI `RegisterProviderBody` now describes the actual body, `{ metadata, adapter_id, secret_ref?, adapter_config? }`; it used to describe `ProviderMetadata`.
    - `ProviderCost` allows adapter-specific rate fields.
  - `@kindgi/client`: the generated `RegisterProviderBody` follows.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the providers skill covers Gemini on Vertex, and `adapter_config`. It also notes that the OpenAI-compat adapter isn't registered by the runtime yet.
- aec851d: Fallback providers. `ProviderMetadata.fallback: true` makes a provider serve a capability only when no other provider satisfies it; `route()` then reports `fallback: true`, and a fallback is never an alternate to a regular pick. An agent turn routed to one carries a `fallback-provider` warning (`AgentTurnResult.warnings`). `dev-echo` is a fallback, so registering a real model takes over from it with nothing to switch off — before, ties went to the provider id that sorts first, and `dev-echo` beat `gemini`, `groq` or `ollama`. `POST /v1/providers` accepts and returns `fallback`; the clients carry it. The providers and getting-started skills describe it, and register Anthropic or Gemini with `kindgi providers register --preset` (the CLI's presets).
- aec851d: A runtime can keep a run's state in memory, and publish journal entries in batches.
  
  - `@kindgi/runtime`:
    - `createRunState()`, `applyJournalEntry(state, entry)` and `cloneRunState(state)`.
      - `deriveRunState(journal)` is the fold of the first two.
      - A runtime reads a run's journal once, then applies each entry it writes, instead of reading the journal again.
      - It dispatches against a clone, so a running step sees the run as it was when the step was dispatched.
    - `KernelEventBusBinding.publishMany?(tenantId, channel, docs)` (optional): publish entries that were written together, in one call. The runtime uses it when the binding has it, and `publish` for each entry otherwise.
  - `@kindgi/api`: `EventBusBinding.publishMany?` (optional). It works like `publish` for each doc, with consecutive `seq`s and one notification.
- aec851d: Public run tokens: a browser can follow a run's progress without a secret API token.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `CreateAppInput.publicRunTokens` (`signingKey` + `keyId`, an Ed25519 key; lifetimes; `allowedOrigins`). When set, `POST /v1/runs` returns `publicAccessToken` + `publicAccessTokenExpiresAt` (15 minutes by default), and `POST /v1/tokens/public` mints tokens for up to 50 runs (at most 24 hours).
    - Progress routes: `GET /v1/runs/{runId}/progress` (`RunProgress`: status and timing, no input, output or failure message) and `GET /v1/runs/{runId}/progress/stream` (`RunProgressEvent`: kind, node, sequence, time; no payload). They accept an API token or a public run token. `GET /v1/runs/{runId}` and `/stream` are unchanged and keep requiring an API token.
    - A public run token (`kgi_pt_…`, Ed25519-signed, stateless) is accepted only by the two progress routes (every other route answers 403), for the runs it names and their descendants (others answer 404).
    - The routes a public token may use come from the operation registry (`security: 'bearer-or-public-run'`); the OpenAPI document declares the `publicRunToken` security scheme on them.
    - CORS for `allowedOrigins` on the two progress routes only, ahead of authentication.
    - `mintPublicRunToken` / `verifyPublicRunToken` for deployments that issue tokens themselves.
  - `@kindgi/client`:
    - `subscribeToRun({ apiUrl, runId, accessToken, refreshAccessToken })`: follow a run's progress from a browser with a public token, refreshing it when it expires.
    - `runs.progress`, `runs.streamProgress`, `tokens.createPublic`.
    - `runs.stream` now follows the run to its terminal event: when the server ends the stream at its time limit, it reconnects from the last event instead of ending early. `followRun` is the shared loop; `readSse` takes `lastEventId` and per-attempt `headers`, and throws `SseHttpError` (with `status`) on HTTP errors.
  - `@kindgi/env-schema`: `KINDGI_PUBLIC_TOKEN_SIGNING_KEY_PATH` and `KINDGI_CORS_ORIGINS`.
- aec851d: Runs return their output, record which run started them, and can be started without waiting.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - Run responses (`GET /v1/runs/:runId`, start, cancel, resume) include `output` once the run completed. Lists include it only with `?include=output`.
    - A child run carries `parentRunId` and `parentNodeId`. `GET /v1/runs` filters with `?parentRunId=` (a run's children) or `?topLevel=true`.
    - `POST /v1/runs` accepts `options.wait: false`: the binding returns the run id as soon as the run exists and the route answers `202`. The default still answers `201` once the run completes, fails or suspends. `InvokeAgentBindingInput` and `InvokeFlowBindingInput` gain `wait`.
    - `POST /v1/runs/:runId/resume` resumes the run through the host's run handler after completing the waitpoint; the run used to stay suspended. Waitpoint ids starting with `child:` are reserved for the runtime (`400`).
    - New status mappings: `flow-unbound`, `flow-runs-not-supported` and `flow-resume-not-supported` → `422`.
  - `@kindgi/runtime`:
    - `ParentRunRef`, and `parent` on `RunFlowInput` / `StartRunParams`.
    - `RunFlowInput.runId` adopts a `pending` row created by `startRun`.
    - `HandlerResolver` (`handlerResolver` on `RunFlowInput` / `ResumeRunInput`) binds handlers for child flows.
    - `KernelRunRecord.parentRunId` / `parentNodeId` / `parentScope`; `ListRunsInput.parent` and `topLevelOnly`.
    - `KernelRunRecord.output` is documented as the output value itself, not a storage envelope.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `Run.output`, `Run.parentRunId` / `parentNodeId`; `runs.list({ parentRunId, topLevel, includeOutput })`; `StartRunOptions.wait`.
- aec851d: The JSON Schemas now describe what the code accepts (agent 1.1.0, capability 1.1.0, flow 1.9.0, guardrail 1.1.0, pack 1.1.0). The bundled copies in `@kindgi/capabilities`, `@kindgi/flow` and `@kindgi/guardrails` match.
  
  - **BREAKING — `agent.schema.json` 1.1.0:** `tools` entries are `{ id, version }` references (`version` is an npm semver range), matching `ToolRef` and `defineAgent`. Agent JSON with bare-string tool ids — which `defineAgent` already rejected — now fails schema validation too.
  - **BREAKING — `pack.schema.json` 1.1.0:** a pack agent's `tools` use the same `{ id, version }` references (`agent.schema.json#/$defs/ToolRef`). Pack manifests with bare-string tool ids now fail validation.
  - **`capability.schema.json` 1.1.0:** new optional `kind` (default `llm-inference`), which the router already reads, and a `models` requirement (`{ models: { allow?, deny? } }`) next to `providers`. `defineCapability` validates through this schema, so it now accepts both.
  - **BREAKING — `flow.schema.json` 1.9.0:** the top-level `triggers` array is gone. No code read it — schedules, event triggers and webhooks are registered through their own APIs and name the flow they start. Flow JSON that still declares `triggers` now fails `loadFlow`.
  - **BREAKING — `guardrail.schema.json` 1.1.0:** `check` is required, as in the `Guardrail` type (`defineGuardrail` already failed without a registered check), and a `retry` action requires `maxAttempts`. `POST /v1/guardrails` rejects a spec without `check`.
  - **`guardrail.schema.json` 1.1.0 (widening, not breaking):** `kind` and `on-violation` accept any non-empty string — the built-ins are listed as `examples` — so `defineGuardrail`, `validateGuardrailSpec`, the API and the client accept adapter kinds and custom actions. `defineGuardrail` still requires a registered check of the guardrail's kind, and still checks the action's shape. The schema also allows `sandbox`, `limits`, `network` and `needsSpec`, which the type declares, with the same shapes as on tools.
  - **`@kindgi/guardrails`:** when `evaluateGuardrail` runs with `EvaluationBindings.actions` and the fired action has no registered handler, it returns the new `unknown-action` error naming the action (after the violation is recorded) instead of skipping the action silently.
  - **`@kindgi/api` / `@kindgi/client`:** the `Guardrail` wire schema and client types require `check` and `retry.maxAttempts`, and take `kind` / `on-violation` as open strings.
  - **`@kindgi/specs` README:** until the first stable release, a breaking schema change is a minor bump with a version-history note; the major-`$id` rule applies from 1.0.0.
- aec851d: A tenant can hold every agent to its own approval rules: a new policy kind, `hitl`.
  
  - `@kindgi/policy-contract`:
    - **The kind.** `hitl` joins `POLICY_KINDS`. Its spec, `HitlSpec` (`{ maxTimeoutMs?, minReviewerRole?, tools? }`), only tightens an agent's own approval rules: the shorter timeout, the higher reviewer role, and per tool id the stricter gate. `tools` maps a tool id to a mode (`never_ask`, `ask_on_first_use`, `always_ask`) or a rule `{ mode, requiredRole? }`.
    - **Exports.** `HitlSpec`, `ToolHitlMode`, `ToolHitlRule`, `ReviewerRole`, `TOOL_HITL_MODES`, `REVIEWER_ROLES`, `validateHitlSpec`, `combineHitlSpecs` (one spec at least as strict as each), and the helpers `toolHitlRule`, `stricterToolHitlRule`, `higherRole`.
    - **`validatePolicySpec(kind, spec)`** checks a spec against its kind's contract, for `tool-errors` and `hitl`. Other kinds pass.
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Applied per turn.** A turn resolves its approval rules once, at `setup` (and again when it resumes): the agent's `conversationPolicy.hitl`, held to the tenant's `hitl` policy through `policyRegistry`. Each tool call is gated by the stricter of the agent's rule for that tool and the tenant's.
    - **Fails closed.** When the tenant's `hitl` policy can't be evaluated, the turn fails with the new `tenant-policy-unavailable` error (`TenantPolicyUnavailableError`, which carries `policyKind`). Running without the policy would skip the tenant's approvals. No `hitl` executor bound means no tenant policy, as before.
    - **Breaking (preview):** `resolveEffectiveHitlPolicy({ tenant, agent })` takes the tenant's `HitlSpec` or `undefined`. `TenantHitlPolicy` is removed. `EffectiveHitlPolicy` gains `toolFloors`. An agent's tool modes and rules use `@kindgi/policy-contract`'s `ToolHitlMode` and `ToolHitlRule`, unchanged in shape.
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - **Checked when written.** `POST /v1/policies` refuses a `tool-errors` or `hitl` spec that breaks its contract, with `validation-failed`. Each issue is pathed under `spec`, e.g. `spec/tools/acme.pay/mode`. Before, such a spec was stored and only found out on a turn.
    - **Status.** `tenant-policy-unavailable` maps to 503. `PolicyKind` includes `hitl`.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `PolicyKind` includes `hitl`. The Python client's models do too.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the agents skills (TypeScript and Python) say a tenant's `hitl` policy can tighten an agent's gates, never loosen them.
- aec851d: Failed tool calls go back to the model to correct, under a policy.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Retries.** When a tool call fails, the failure goes back to the model as the call's result (what failed, the validation issues, what to do), and the turn continues. A failure the policy doesn't retry, or one past its retries, fails the turn as before.
    - **The setting.** `Agent.toolErrors` (`{ maxRetries?, retryOn? }`) sets how many failed calls go back per turn and for which kinds. Default: one retry, for `invalid-arguments` and `unknown-tool`, where nothing ran. `tool-error` (a tool that ran and failed) is opt-in.
    - **Bounds.** Each retry costs a step against `budget.maxSteps`. Retries are counted from the turn's messages, so a replayed turn counts the same.
    - **Errors.** `tool-invocation-failed` and `unresolved-tool` carry `toolRetries` when retries ran out.
    - **Exports.** `DEFAULT_TOOL_ERRORS` and `effectiveToolErrorPolicy`. A rejected HITL tool approval writes its result through the same path as a retry.
  - `@kindgi/policy-contract`:
    - A new policy kind, `tool-errors`. It caps an agent's setting, like every tenant policy: the fewer retries wins, and only kinds both allow are retried.
    - `ToolErrorsSpec`, `ToolErrorKind`, `TOOL_ERROR_KINDS`, `MAX_TOOL_ERROR_RETRIES` (10), and `validateToolErrorsSpec`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.3.0 adds `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `toolErrors` (`ToolErrorsSpec`). `PolicyKind` derives from `POLICY_KINDS`, so it includes `tool-errors`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `PolicyKind` includes `tool-errors`, and the generated agent types carry `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the agents skill covers `output` and `toolErrors`, and `preferredModel` as `defineAgent` keeps it.
- aec851d: Outbound webhooks: endpoints that receive a signed `run.finished` event when a top-level run completes, fails or is cancelled.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `WebhookEndpointBinding` (caller-plugged) and `/v1/webhook-endpoints`: create (the response carries the signing secret, once), list, get, update, `unregister`, `rotate-secret`, the delivery log (`/deliveries`, with a status filter), `redeliver`, and `test` (queues a `webhook.test` event).
    - Endpoint filter: `projectId`, `flowIds`, `includeDryRuns`. Child runs never produce `run.finished`.
    - Event bodies (`RunFinishedEvent`, `WebhookTestEvent`) carry the run's identity and outcome (`FinishedRun`), never its input or output. The OpenAPI document describes them under `webhooks`.
    - Error codes: `webhook-endpoint-not-found`, `webhook-delivery-not-found` (404), `webhook-url-refused` (400).
  - `@kindgi/crypto`: Standard Webhooks signatures (`v1`, HMAC-SHA256): `signWebhook`, `webhookHeaders`, `verifyWebhook` (timestamp tolerance, several signatures during a secret rotation, constant-time comparison) and `generateWebhookSecret` (`whsec_…`). Checked against the reference implementation both ways.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `client.webhookEndpoints`. The unused outbound shapes `Webhook`, `WebhookSpec`, `WebhookSecret`, `WebhookDelivery`, `WebhookVerifyResult` and the `WebhookId` / `WebhookDeliveryId` brands are replaced by the generated wire types and `WebhookEndpointId`; `SubscriptionSpec`'s webhook target is `{ kind: 'webhook', endpoint }`.
  - `@kindgi/types`: `WebhookEndpointId` and `WebhookEventId`. `WebhookId` is documented as what it is: the routable id of an inbound webhook trigger.
- aec851d: Webhook endpoints reference their signing secret by name instead of generating and returning one.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - Endpoints take `secretRef: { envName, name }`, a secret in the deployment's secrets store (resolved at tenant scope), like a provider's `secret_ref`. The secret is shared with the receiver, so it lives with the deployment's other secrets: `.env` in development, the secrets store in production. Endpoints show `secretRef`; `secretHint` is gone.
    - Create and update check that the secret exists and is strong (`400 webhook-secret-not-found`, `400 webhook-secret-too-weak`). `create` returns the endpoint (no secret).
    - `POST /v1/webhook-endpoints/generate-secret` returns a strong secret to store; nothing is kept.
    - `POST /v1/webhook-endpoints/{endpointId}/rotate-secret` and `WebhookEndpointWithSecret` are removed: rotating is rotating the referenced secret (`POST /v1/secrets/{name}/rotate`), and for a day deliveries are signed with both versions.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `webhookEndpoints.create` takes `secretRef` and returns the endpoint; `webhookEndpoints.generateSecret()`; `rotateSecret` is removed.
  - `@kindgi/crypto`: `isStrongWebhookSecret` and `WEBHOOK_SECRET_MIN_BYTES` (24).

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: What a provider registration can make the server reach, for Gemini and for every provider's region.
  
  - **`metadata.region` must be one DNS label** (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; e.g. `us-central1`, `global`, `unspecified`). Anything else is `400 invalid-provider`, reason `invalid-region`. The Gemini adapter builds its hostname from the region (`https://<region>-aiplatform.googleapis.com/`), so `evil.example/x?` used to move the request to another host. With no `secret_ref`, that request carried the server's own Google credentials.
  - **The Gemini adapter** checks its target itself: the location is one DNS label, and `adapter_config.project` is a Google Cloud project id or number, since it goes into the request path. This holds for `createGeminiProvider` too, not only the factory.
  - **A Gemini `secret_ref` must be a service-account key** (`"type": "service_account"`), reduced to its key fields. Other credential types made the auth library fetch URLs the "key" named, with its headers, or read a file named in it. A key's `token_uri` or `universe_domain` could move the token exchange elsewhere. Google's own token endpoint is always used now.
- aec851d: `KernelError` gains `RunLeaseLostError` (`code: 'run-lease-lost'`): the executor no longer holds the run's lease, because another executor claimed the run after this one's lease expired. It stops without failing or finishing the run, and the lease holder decides what happens to it. `@kindgi/api` maps it to 409, like `run-already-terminal`.
- aec851d: The OpenAPI run status says `pending` where it said `queued`. The server sends `pending` for a run that hasn't started yet, which is what `options.wait: false` answers, and a validating client (the Python client, or one generated with runtime validation) refused that response. A test now holds the document to the runtime's `RunStatus`.
- aec851d: Wire-contract fixes in the API routes and their OpenAPI document.
  
  - **`StartRunBody`**: the agent variant declares the optional `projectId` (UUID) that `POST /v1/runs` already accepts for agent runs. Clients that validate against the schema (it sets `additionalProperties: false`) no longer reject a valid request. Both variants now describe `projectId`: omitted, the run goes to the tenant's Default project.
  - **`PublishAgentBody`, `PublishFlowBody`, `RegisterToolBody`, `RegisterGuardrailBody`, `PublishEvalSuiteBody`, `StartEvalRunBody`**: declare the `projectId` (UUID) their routes already require — `POST /v1/agents`, `/v1/flows`, `/v1/tools`, `/v1/guardrails`, `/v1/eval-suites` and `/v1/eval-suites/:suiteId/runs` answer `400 bad-input` when it is missing or isn't a project of the caller's tenant. It is now listed in `required`, so the documented bodies are the ones the routes accept; before, a schema-validating client rejected every valid request.
  - **`WhoamiResult`**: declares `user` (a `UserRecord`), which `GET /v1/identity/whoami` returns when the deployment wires an identity directory that knows the caller's `userId`.
  - **`GET /v1/audit/authz`**: `?onBehalfOf=`, `?action=` and `?resource=` are now applied in the audit query rather than to the returned page, so a page is full while matching decisions remain and `nextCursor` / `hasMore` are exact. Previously a page could come back short, or empty, with `hasMore: true`. To support this, `AuditEventFilter` (`@kindgi/audit-events`) gains `onBehalfOf` (matches `AuditEvent.onBehalfOf`) and `payloadDoc` (every entry must equal the same field of `payload.doc`); the in-memory binding implements both. A binding that doesn't implement them yet still returns only matching decisions, because the route re-checks the three filters on each page.
  - **`GET /v1/tenant/config`**: now cursor-paginated across the env and secrets bindings. The list is the env entries (in the env binding's order) followed by the secret entries (in the secrets binding's order); a page holds at most `limit` entries, and `nextCursor` / `hasMore` are set when more remain. Previously each binding returned up to `limit` entries (up to twice `limit` in all, sorted by `updatedAt`), `?cursor=` was passed to both bindings unchanged, and `hasMore` was always `false`, so entries past the first page were unreachable. A malformed cursor, or one pointing into a binding the current `?kind=` excludes, returns `400 bad-input`.
  - **`GET /v1/runs/:runId/stream`**: when an event bus is wired but subscribing fails, the stream now falls back to polling the journal as documented. Previously it ended right after the backfill, before the run's later events.
- aec851d: A run blocked by a guardrail now says which one, and clients get it as a typed error.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`: the `guardrail-violation` message (and the `turn.failed` event's) names each blocking guardrail with its check's reason — `Turn blocked by guardrail 'no-pii': Response contains an email` — instead of only counting them.
  - `@kindgi/client` (re-exported by `@kindgi/sdk`): new `GuardrailViolationError` variant of `KindgiError` (`code: 'guardrail-violation'`, `violations[]` with `guardrailId` / `severity` / `action` / `reason?`, `evaluationErrors[]`). `fromWire()` previously returned it as a generic `ServerError`. Exhaustive `switch (err.code)` statements need the new case.
  - `@kindgi/api`: `POST /v1/runs` sends a binding failure's `details` as the wire error's `details`; they were nested under `details.details`, so clients could not read them.
- aec851d: Memory routes reject a scope that names another tenant. `POST /v1/memory/facts`, `POST /v1/memory/retrieve` and `GET /v1/memory/facts?scope=` now answer `400 scope-mismatch` when `scope.tenantId` differs from the caller's tenant (from the token), before the binding is called — the same rule as the secrets, env and policy routes. Previously the write route passed the body's scope through unchecked, so an implementation that writes under `scope.tenantId` could be made to write into another tenant. `MemoryWriteFactInput.tenantId` is documented as the tenant to write under.
- aec851d: OpenAPI descriptions (`openapi.json`, tag and operation text) now describe what each route does and nothing outside the package: corrected status codes and pagination notes (e.g. deployment secret sync answers `404 secret-not-found`; tenant `GET /config` returns a single page; identity-provider registration is not idempotent), no runtime-internal tables, bridges or adapters, and no roadmap notes. Paths, operations, schemas and status codes are unchanged.
- aec851d: Documentation clean-up across the `@kindgi/*` packages: comments, READMEs, OpenAPI descriptions and a few error / "not yet wired" messages no longer point at documents outside this repository or carry internal development-process labels; sample names in examples and tests are neutral (`acme`, `globex`). No behaviour changes.
- aec851d: S3 SigV4 verification now re-derives the signature from exactly what the client signed. Previously header-signed requests only verified when signing and verification fell in the same wall-clock second (the server re-signed with its own clock), and any header added after signing (proxies, the HTTP stack) broke verification; presigned URLs had no expiry check.
  
  - Uses the client's `x-amz-date` / `X-Amz-Date`; rejects requests more than 15 minutes from the server clock (`RequestTimeTooSkewed`).
  - Canonicalizes only the headers listed in `SignedHeaders`; requires `host`, `x-amz-date` and `x-amz-content-sha256` to be signed (header auth).
  - Presigned URLs: enforces `X-Amz-Expires` (`AccessDenied: Request has expired`; at most 7 days, else `AuthorizationQueryParametersError`).
  - `aws4` is no longer a runtime dependency.
- aec851d: Fine-grained authorization now checks the scope a request acts on. Each route derives its scope once, with the same parser for the check and the handler.
  
  - `/v1/env` and `/v1/secrets`: the check reads `scopeKind` + `scopeId`, the parameters the handlers use. It previously read `projectId` / `orgId` query parameters, which are not part of the API, so a request could be checked against one scope and act on another, and project-scoped callers using `scopeId` were checked against the tenant.
  - `POST /v1/secrets/{name}/rotate`: the scope comes from body `scope`, else from the query; when both are present they must name the same scope (400 `scope-mismatch`), and body `envName` must match query `envName` (400 `env-name-mismatch`). The OpenAPI document now declares the optional `envName`, `scopeKind` and `scopeId` query parameters.
  - `POST /v1/mcp/endpoints`: the check reads body `scopeKind` + `scopeId`, as the handler does. `RegisterMCPEndpointBody` now declares them (`scopeKind` required).
  - Registry lists (`/v1/agents`, `/v1/flows`, `/v1/tools`, `/v1/guardrails`, `/v1/eval-suites`): a project filter (`scopeKind=project&scopeId=`) requires `read` on that project.
  - Env and secrets routes run one authorization check per request (previously two).
  
  `@kindgi/client`: `mcp.endpoints.register` takes a required `scope` and sends it as `scopeKind` + `scopeId`; the API has always required them, so registering through the client failed before. `not-yet-wired` reasons for `tools.manifests` and `packs.*` are reworded.
- aec851d: Typed agent output and structured turn input.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Typed output.** An agent can declare `output: { schema, name?, maxRepairs? }` (JSON Schema, or a Zod schema converted by `defineAgent`).
      - The final answer must be JSON matching the schema; a fenced JSON block is accepted.
      - An answer that doesn't fit is sent back to the model with the problems listed, up to `maxRepairs` times (default 1, counted against `budget.maxSteps`). After that the turn fails with `output-schema-violation` (`errors`, `attempts`).
      - The parsed answer is `AgentTurnResult.output`, or `null` on a dry run, where no answer is checked.
    - `AgentTurnResult.runId` is the turn's kernel run.
    - **Structured input.** `invokeAgent({ input })` makes `{{ input.* }}` available to the instructions (`input` joins `AUTO_INJECTED_VARS`). It is kept in the run snapshot and passed to guardrails as `trace.attributes.stepInput`.
    - **Parent link.** `invokeAgent({ parent })` records the run that started the turn, for turns started by a flow step.
    - **Resume.** The run snapshot keeps `parameters` and `input`, and `resumeAgentTurn` restores them; a resumed turn used to lose its parameters. Migration `0002` adds the two columns to `agent_run_snapshots`.
    - **Guardrail trace.** `buildRunTrace` now takes the run id, project id, turn number and user message. The trace carries them, so failed checks during a turn produce compliance evidence. Before, `runId` was the conversation id, `turnCount` was the step count, and `projectId` was missing. `attributes.steps` replaces `attributes.turnCount`; a typed answer appears as `attributes.structuredOutput`.
    - `defineAgent` keeps `preferredModel`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.2.0 adds `output`, `preferredProvider` and `preferredModel`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `output`, `conversationPolicy`, `preferredModel`, `description` and `tags`.
  - `@kindgi/dev-echo-provider`: a call with no tools gets the last user message back as the answer, instead of a call to an echo tool the agent doesn't have.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `output` (`AgentOutputSpec`); `output-schema-violation` maps to 422.
  - `@kindgi/client`: the generated agent types carry `output`.
