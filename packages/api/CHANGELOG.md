### Patch Changes

- 5608264: A gated scope holds its own live version, and a change above it can't move it without its gate.
  
  - **Publishing or reinstating a gate policy** for a scope with no pin of its own is refused (`409 gate-policy-scope-unpinned`), even when a scope above it is pinned. A promotion there would otherwise change the gated scope without its gate.
  - **A promotion, rollback or unpin** that would also move a narrower gated scope with no pin of its own (one gated before this rule) is refused with the new `409 gate-policy-descendant-unpinned`. The message names each such scope and its current version: pin it there first. A gated promotion's approval re-checks this, and is `superseded` if it would.
  - **A pin in place skips the gate.** Promoting a scope that has no live version of its own to exactly the version it serves now (the fix the new 409 asks for) changes nothing any run gets. So the gate's checks and approval don't apply: it's `201`, with one passing `pinInPlace` check, the policy recorded, and a reason starting `pin-in-place`; `…/promotions/check` says the same. `PromotionRequestInput.gate.pinInPlace` tells the binding, which re-checks it as it writes (`409 promotion-superseded` if the scope moved).
  - **The follower guard only refuses a real change:** a promotion that leaves a gated follower on the version it already serves goes through.
  - **Unpinning a gated scope's own pin** is `409 gate-policy-needs-pin`: unregister the gate policy first, or roll back instead.
  - **Clients:** `gate-policy-descendant-unpinned` is a conflict in TypeScript and Python, like the other gate codes.

## 0.1.4-rc.3

### Patch Changes

- 3e427c5: `kindgi runs resume <run-id>` says what a run waits for before it resumes, with an exit code per answer:
  - **0:** the run isn't waiting (running, or finished).
  - **3:** it waits for an approval. The command names the approval and the command that decides it (`kindgi approvals complete <id> --decision=approve` or `--decision=reject`).
  - **4:** it waits on the runtime: a queued start, a child run, a scheduled retry and when, or a lease another run holds. A wait no approval matches is also 4, with a line pointing to `kindgi approvals list --status=pending`.
  - **5:** reserved for a held run.
  
  It reads the run, its journal's open waits, and the approvals linked to them. The never-wired `--waitpoint` and `--value` flags are gone.
  
  `GET /v1/approvals` takes `waitTokenId`, repeatable and at most 50: only approvals linked to those run waits. `ListApprovalsBindingInput.waitTokenIds` carries it to the binding. The TypeScript client's `approvals.list({ waitTokenIds })` and the Python client's `approvals.list(wait_token_id=[…])` send it.

## 0.1.4-rc.2

### Patch Changes

- 0b1f48d: `GET /v1/audit/authz` takes `?order=asc|desc`. `asc` (the default, as before) lists the oldest decisions first; `desc` lists the newest first, and `nextCursor` continues in the same order. Any other value is `400 bad-input`. The TypeScript client's `audit.authz.list({ order })` and the Python client's `audit.authz.list(order=…)` send it. `AuditEventBinding.query` takes an optional `order` (`AuditEventOrder`); the in-memory binding implements it, and a binding that doesn't pages oldest first.
- 2b34f78: A request the authorizer denies (on the agents, flows, tools and other routes with authorization on) answers its 403 in the error envelope every other error uses: `{ error: { code: 'permission-denied', message, details: { action, resource, reason }, requestId } }`. It was a bare `{ code, action, resource, reason }`, which the TypeScript client and the CLI reported as "HTTP 403 without recognizable error envelope"; both clients now read it as a forbidden auth error. `@kindgi/authz`'s `DenyPayload` doc describes it as the denial's `details`.
- 9a7f43b: A comparison's live baseline names its segments as a path, the way live versions resolve them: `baseline: { live: { projectId, segments: [{ key, value }, …] } }`, coarse to fine. It was an unordered object (`{ tier: 'gold' }`), so a path's order was lost. `segments` follows the rules of a run's and a pin's segment path (lowercase keys, each key once, at most 8), needs `projectId`, and anything else is `400 bad-input`. The CLI's `eval-runs start --baseline-segment` takes `<key>:<value>` (it took `<key>=<value>`), once per step in order, and needs `--baseline-project`. A live baseline is still refused when the run starts (only `recorded` runs today).
- fcc6a97: An error code a client doesn't list is read by its HTTP status. Until now any newer code, such as a 404 `org-not-found`, became a server error. Now, in the TypeScript and Python clients:
  - 404 and 410 are a not-found (the resource's kind comes from the code: `org` for `org-not-found`);
  - 401 and 403 are an auth error (unauthenticated or forbidden);
  - 429 is rate-limited;
  - 400 is an invalid request.
  
  Codes the clients list keep their class; the list now also has the 409 codes of the already-registered family (`eval-suite-already-registered`, `policy-already-registered`, `mcp-endpoint-already-registered`, `identity-provider-already-registered`, `version-already-exists`, `eval-run-already-terminal`, `approval-already-decided`, `judge-class-name-taken`), conflicts like their listed siblings, the promotion gate's 409s (`promotion-superseded`, `gate-policy-already-registered`, `gate-policy-scope-taken`, `gate-policy-scope-changed`, `gate-policy-scope-unpinned`, `gate-policy-needs-pin`) are conflicts too, and the TypeScript client now also lists `policy-scope-taken` and `policy-scope-changed`, as the Python client did. 409 and 422 codes they don't list stay server errors, matched by their code, as the docs show (`budget-exceeded`, `agent-version-mismatch`). In TypeScript, every error from the server now carries the wire code as `serverCode`, whatever its family (Python's `server_code` already did). `@kindgi/api`'s OpenAPI document lists every error code and its status as `WireError['x-error-codes']`, and the clients' tests check against it.
- 86ec2ef: A conversation id that isn't one (a UUID) in `GET /v1/conversations/{conversationId}`, `…/messages` or `POST …/close` is `400 bad-input`: "`conversationId` must be a conversation id (a UUID)", as a run id is. Before, it reached the database and answered `500 persistence-error`.
- e97958c: Conversation lists leave a comparison's replay conversations out, as run lists leave out replay runs. `GET /v1/conversations` takes `replays=exclude|include|only` (default `exclude`); a replay conversation is one whose `metadata` has `replayOf`. `ListConversationsPageInput.replays` passes it to the binding (absent: include, for internal callers).
  
  The TypeScript client's `conversations.list` and the Python client take `replays`. `kindgi conversations list` now lists, with `--status`, `--replays`, `--limit` and `--cursor` (the other `conversations` commands stay unwired).
- e2ab2ac: A deployment fails, and rolls back what it published, when one of its tools, guardrails, agents or flows comes back from its registry refused with a typed outcome such as `project-not-found`. Before, `POST /v1/deployments` kept only `ok`, and skipped every other outcome, so the deployment was recorded without that primitive. It now answers that outcome's own status and code (`404 project-not-found`), with `details.primitive` and `details.id` naming the primitive: "The agent acme.drafting@1.0.0 wasn't published: project-not-found; nothing was deployed". `already-registered` (that id and version are stored) is still skipped, as an idempotent redeploy expects; anything a registry throws is still a 500, rolled back.
- 7528aca: Publishing a flow (`POST /v1/flows`, or a deploy) pins each agent step that names no version to what a run in the flow's project would get: the agent's live version there (project, then its org, then the tenant), else its latest. Before, it pinned the latest, so in a tenant with promotions a new flow ran a version that was never let go live. A step's own `config.version` still wins; without live versions, pins are the latest as before.
- e58e35c: A gated scope always resolves to a pin: publishing a gate policy for a scope that nothing covering it pins is refused (`409 gate-policy-scope-unpinned`, "pin a version for this scope, or one above it, first"), and so is an unpin that would leave a gated scope on the latest version (`409 gate-policy-needs-pin`), where publishing would go live ungated. A gate policy's `spec.comparison.required` is gone: a promotion must name a comparison exactly when the spec has `comparison`, `evidence`, `metrics` or `replay`. A promotion its gate refused is the audit and evidence kind `agent-promotion-refused`.
- 8491dd8: A judge class can be restricted to some judges. `assertableBy` on `POST /v1/judge-classes` and `PATCH /v1/judge-classes/{judgeClassId}` (`null` on the PATCH lifts it) takes `minReviewerRole`, `principalKinds` and `principalIds`, and a caller must meet each one given. A judgment that names a restricted class its caller doesn't meet is `403 judge-class-not-allowed`, and the message says why. A judgment recorded under a restricted class carries `restricted: true`; adding or lifting a restriction later doesn't change it. A test set's items carry `restricted`: the yes and total weight of those judgments alone.
  
  A comparison takes `classWeights`: `as-recorded` (the default, every judgment at its class's weight) or `restricted-only` (only judgments carrying `restricted` count; an item with none counts as unjudged). The summary records which one it used. A gate policy's spec takes `onlyRestrictedClasses`: the promotion's comparison must be `restricted-only` (check `classWeights.restrictedOnly`), so a class anyone may assert can't move the gate.
  
  `@kindgi/api` exports `whyNotAssertable`, `JudgeClassAssertableBy`, `JudgeClassAsserter` and `EvalClassWeights`. The TypeScript client's judge-class types take `assertableBy`, and `evalRuns.start` takes `classWeights`. The Python client sends both (`assertable_by=None` lifts a restriction). The CLI's `judge-classes add` and `set` take `--min-reviewer-role`, `--principal-kind` and `--principal-id`, `set --unrestricted` lifts the restriction, and `eval-runs start` takes `--class-weights`.
- 933e00a: Every list call answers in one shape, the wire's page: `data`, `hasMore` and `nextCursor`, as the API and the Python client have it. The calls that answered `{ items, nextCursor }` (adapters, approvals, artifacts, capabilities, conversations, cost, events, flows, guardrails, judge classes, judgments, MCP, memory, observations, packs, policies, provenance, supervisor, tokens, tools and users) now answer `data` and `hasMore` too. `items` keeps working, marked `@deprecated`, and will be removed in 0.2. The client exports the page type as `ListPage<T>`.
  
  `GET /v1/env`, `GET /v1/secrets` and `GET /v1/secrets/{name}/versions` send `hasMore`, and `GET /v1/auth/providers` sends `hasMore: false` (the list comes whole). Against an older server without it, both clients derive `hasMore` from `nextCursor`, so Python's `paginate(client.env.list, …)` and `paginate(client.secrets.list, …)` page through.
- 2040daf: Live versions and promotions. An agent version can be made live for a scope: the tenant, an org, a project, or a segment path inside a project (an ordered list of `key:value` steps, coarse to fine, such as company then role). A run that doesn't name its version uses the live version of the most specific scope that has one, else the latest registered version, and records how its version was chosen.
  
  `@kindgi/api` adds `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live` (the version a run would use for a project and segment path, and why), `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live-versions` (every pin), `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions`, `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions[/{promotionId}]` (the history), and `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/live/rollback` and `/live/unpin`. They're mounted when `createApp` gets `agentReleases` (`AgentReleaseBindings`: a `LiveVersionBinding` and a `PromotionBinding`). Promoting, rolling back and unpinning need the new `promote` action on the agent (`@kindgi/authz`). `POST /v1/runs` takes `segments`; a run carries them (`segments`, a child run has its parent's), and a run's `agent` carries `via` (`explicit`, `conversation`, `live` or `latest`) and, for a live version, `liveScope`. `@kindgi/types` adds `LiveScope`, `ScopeSegment` and `AgentVersionVia`; `@kindgi/runtime`'s `RunAgentRef` and `@kindgi/agents`' `InvokeAgentInput` carry `via` and `liveScope`, and `InvokeAgentInput` the turn's `segments`; `RunFlowInput`, `StartRunParams` and `KernelRunRecord` carry the run's `segments`, so a flow's agent steps resolve with them after a resume too. `@kindgi/compliance` and `@kindgi/specs` list the evidence kinds `agent-promotion`, `agent-rollback`, `agent-live-unpinned` and `agent-live-pin-inactive` (a live version that was unregistered: runs use the scope above).
  
  `@kindgi/client` adds `client.agents.live` (`resolve`, `list`, `rollback`, `unpin`), `client.agents.promotions` (`create`, `list`, `get`) and `segments` on `runs.start`; an array query value now repeats its key; `agent-version-not-found` and `promotion-not-found` read as not-found, `nothing-to-roll-back` and `not-pinned` as conflicts, `scope-invalid` as an invalid request. The Python client has the same resources and errors. `@kindgi/cli` adds `kindgi agents live | live-versions | promote | rollback | unpin` and `kindgi agents promotions list | get`, and wires `kindgi agents list | get | versions | unregister`; `kindgi runs start` takes `--project` and `--segment=key:value` (repeated); `get` and `unregister` take the version as an argument (`kindgi agents unregister <agent-id> <version>`). A command's repeatable flag (`--segment=company:acme --segment=role:counsel`) keeps every value.
- 71412f6: With authorization enforced, every membership change keeps the authorization store in step. `TenantHierarchyBinding` gains optional `removeTeamMember`, `updateTeamMemberRole`, `removeProjectMember` and `updateProjectMemberRole`, which change the membership row and its authorization tuple together. With an authorizer wired, `DELETE` and `PATCH /v1/{teams,projects}/{id}/memberships/{userId}` go through them. A binding without them is refused with `501 authz-membership-unsupported`, and nothing is changed. Without an authorizer, the membership bindings are used, as before.
  
  With authorization enforced, registering or unregistering an approval reviewer (`POST /v1/approvals/reviewers`, `POST /v1/approvals/reviewers/{id}/unregister`) needs `admin` on the tenant. Reading the roster doesn't.
- ba2f212: `GET /v1/observations`'s `agentVersion`, `conversationId`, `since` and `until` filters, which the route already read, are in the OpenAPI spec, so the Python client's `observations.list` takes them. `kindgi observations` and `kindgi proposals` say why they aren't available instead of "not yet wired": the Kindgi runtime doesn't record supervisor observations or draft fix proposals yet. A reason given for a group covers each of its commands.
- e7e2f86: A write whose body names a project it can't use is refused before anything is written: a `projectId` that isn't a project id (a UUID) is `400 bad-input` ("`projectId` must be a project id (a UUID)"), and one that names no project of the tenant is `404 project-not-found` (`details.projectId`). This covers `POST /v1/runs`, `/v1/tokens`, `/v1/agents`, `/v1/agents/{agentId}/versions`, `/v1/flows`, `/v1/tools`, `/v1/guardrails`, `/v1/eval-suites`, `…/versions/from-judgments`, `/v1/eval-suites/{suiteId}/runs` and `/v1/blocks`. Before, an unknown project failed the runtime's insert as a `500` whose message named a table and a foreign key. `POST /v1/conversations` keeps its documented `400 bad-input` for an unknown project. `@kindgi/platform`'s in-memory project binding makes UUID ids, as the wire's `Project.id` is.
- 42a2e66: Promotions go through a gate (evals step 4b). A **gate policy** says what a promotion of an agent for a scope must show: a recent comparison of that exact version against the one live there, with enough judged evidence, metrics that reach a floor or drop no more than allowed, clean replays, and optionally a reviewer's approval.
  
  - **`/v1/gate-policies`**: publish (`{id, version, agentId, scope, spec}`), list, get, `versions` list / get / unregister / reinstate. One policy per agent and scope (`409 gate-policy-scope-taken`, `details.heldBy`); the most specific scope with a policy applies. The `spec` is checked strictly. Writes need `admin` on the tenant.
  - **`POST /v1/agents/{id}/promotions`** checks the scope's policy against the comparison named by `evalRunId`. It answers `201` (`status: 'promoted'`), `202` (`status: 'pending-approval'`, with `approvalId`: a reviewer approves it, and the version goes live if nothing changed meanwhile), or `422 gate-failed` with every check in `details.checks`. The refusal is recorded too. A promotion now carries `status`, `policy`, `checks`, `approvalId` and `resolvedAt`. With no policy for the scope, nothing changes.
  - **`POST /v1/agents/{id}/promotions/check`** answers what the gate would say (`would-promote`, `needs-approval`, `gate-failed`), recording nothing. **`GET /v1/agents/{id}/gate-policy`** answers the policy that applies to a scope.
  - **A comparison's summary records the candidate's `pinsDigest`**, so the gate can tell the promoted version ran exactly what was compared. A comparison recorded before this has none, and the gate asks for it to be re-run.
  - The TypeScript client has `gatePolicies.*`, `agents.promotions.check` and `agents.gatePolicy.resolve`; the Python client has `gate_policies`, `agents.promotions.check` and `agents.gate_policy.resolve`. The CLI has `kindgi gate-policies list | show | versions | publish | unregister | reinstate`, `kindgi agents gate-policy` and `kindgi agents promote --check`.
- 7155588: The spec says what `GET /v1/provenance?agentId=` matches: the records of that agent's turns, at any version, by the agent the record's run names (as `GET /v1/runs?agentId=`). It said "a DAG node whose `actor` is the agent", which an agent turn never recorded.
- 7471e05: The Python client takes a segment path as `{key, value}` steps, as the TypeScript client and `runs.start` do: `agents.live.resolve(…, segments=[{"key": "company", "value": "acme"}])`, and `segments=` on `agents.promotions.list`, the gate-policy resolve and the gate-policy list (each step a `ScopeSegment` or a mapping). It took `segment=["company:acme"]` strings. The OpenAPI document marks the repeated `segment` query parameter with `x-kindgi-segment-path: true`, which the Python generator honours.
- dc5cfb1: **A decision whose run couldn't go on says so.**
  
  - **`POST /v1/approvals/{id}/complete`** now reports how the inline resume went, in a new `resume` field: `{ kind: 'ok' }`, or `{ kind: 'failed', code, message }` with the run's error, e.g. `tool-version-unresolvable` when a tool version the turn started with is gone. The decision stands either way. Before, a failed resume was dropped silently.
  - **`@kindgi/agents` exports `turnFailureMessage(error)`** (and `parseFailureMessage`). It writes a turn's error as a run's failure message, the form `parseFailureMessage` reads back. A runtime that ends a run from outside its turn uses it, so the run reads as that typed error.
- e2ba026: Retention policies are checked when they're published, a tenant has one per domain, and the retention routes are in the API reference and both clients.
  
  - **`POST /v1/policies` validates a `retention` spec** (`{ v: 1, doc }` or bare): an unknown domain, `mode: "archive"` (not implemented) or a bad grace is `400 validation-failed` naming the field, e.g. `policy.spec/doc/domain must be one of: org, agent, … (got "blocks")`. Before, they were stored and every sweep skipped them.
  - **One retention policy per domain**, plus one for `*`. A second policy id for a covered domain is `409 policy-scope-taken` (`details.heldBy` names the policy that covers it: publish a new version of that one, or unregister it first); a new version can't move a policy to another domain (`409 policy-scope-changed`); reinstating a retired policy whose domain another now covers is `409 policy-scope-taken`. `@kindgi/policy-contract` exports `policyScope` (a retention policy's scope is its domain) and `retentionSpecDoc`; `PolicyRegistryBinding.publish` and `reinstateVersion` gain the `scope-taken` and `scope-changed` outcomes, which the binding enforces under a lock. A runtime that doesn't enforce it yet answers as before.
  - **Policies stored before that rule** can still cover one domain twice: the policy whose latest version is highest applies, then the lower policy id. `GET /v1/retention/scheduled` and the sweeps report them in `conflicts` (`RetentionPolicyConflict`: the domain, the policy ids, the one that applies).
  - **The retention routes are in the OpenAPI spec**: `GET /v1/retention/scheduled`, `POST /v1/retention/sweep` and `POST /v1/retention/sweep/{domain}`. The TypeScript client has `client.retention.scheduled()` and `client.retention.sweep({ domain?, maxPerDomain? })`; the Python client has `client.retention.scheduled()`, `.sweep()` and `.sweep_domain(domain)`, and raises `ConflictError` for `policy-already-registered`, `policy-scope-taken` and `policy-scope-changed`.
- 1bec998: `GET /v1/retention/scheduled` pages like the other lists. `limit` caps the rows per domain, and the page now says `hasMore` when some domain has more than it returned, with a `nextCursor` to pass back as `cursor` when the runtime can continue. Both clients take `cursor`, so Python's `paginate(client.retention.scheduled, …)` pages through. Against a runtime that doesn't page yet, the API derives `hasMore` from whether a domain filled `limit`, and the TypeScript client from whether a `nextCursor` came.
- ffb6096: Unregistering an agent version that's live in a scope is refused with `409 agent-version-live`. The error's `details.scopes` lists the scopes it serves; roll back, unpin, or promote another version there first. Unregister stops a version being chosen, and a live pin is a standing choice, so the pin moves first and a scope never drops to the one above without anyone deciding it. `AgentUnregisterOutcome` gains an optional `live` (the scopes), which a runtime's registry sets; a registry that knows no live versions answers as before. The TypeScript and Python clients read the code as a conflict.
- ae417f7: A flow's agent step that runs the version its flow version holds records `via: 'flow-pin'` on its turn (`Run.agent.via`), not `explicit`: the node's `config.version`, else the version the flow version pinned when it was published. `explicit` now means only a version named on the run itself. In the TypeScript and Python clients, `via` gains the value.

### Patch Changes

- 0359caf: **Data blocks: a settings schema holds for every later version, and a repeated derive returns the version that has it.**
  
  - **A settings version that gives no `schema` keeps the latest version's.** The runtime stores it on the new version, so it's checked on every later version, not just the next one. A version that gives a schema replaces it, and is checked against that schema only. `{}` drops the check on purpose. Before, one edit that didn't restate the schema dropped it for good.
  - **`POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/versions` with a swap an active version already holds** returns that version unchanged (`200`), instead of numbering a duplicate. That covers the same swap derived again, or a deploy that registered it.
  - **Errors:**
    - Publishing an agent that can't be pinned says "uses tool or data-block versions it can't pin" (it said "tool versions", even for a block issue).
    - A template's unresolved settings block is named in full: `settings.acme.reply-style`, not `settings.acme.reply`.
- b8ff156: A flow comparison can run some of the flow's agents or tools at other versions, without publishing a new flow version ("this flow, with `acme.scorer` at 0.4.0"). `POST /v1/eval-suites/{suiteId}/runs` takes `versions: { agents?, tools? }` (id → exact version) with `flowRef`. The run keeps them in `comparison.versions`, each replay runs with them, and the summary's flow `candidate` names them (`versions`).
  
  They're checked when the run starts. An id the flow doesn't use, a version that isn't published, or an unregistered agent version is refused with `400 validation-failed`, each one under `details.issues` (for example `{ path: '/versions/agents/acme.x', message: "flow acme.f 1.2.0 doesn't use agent acme.x" }`). `versions` with `agentRef` is refused.
  
  A run that ran some blocks at other versions says which: `versions` on `GET /v1/runs/{runId}` (`KernelRunRecord.versions`, set from `RunFlowInput.versions` or `StartRunParams.versions`; `InvokeFlowBindingInput.versions` passes them to a runtime). `@kindgi/flow` adds `overridableRefs(flow)`: every tool and agent the flow runs, including agent steps with a version of their own.
  
  The CLI's `kindgi eval-runs start --flow=<id> --flow-version=<v> --with=<id>@<version>` (repeatable) tells agents from tools by the flow version's steps.
- 06b5fc0: Creating a project or team with an `orgId` that names no org of the tenant (one that never existed, or a deleted one), or moving one there, answers `404 org-not-found` (`No org with id "<id>"`), as `GET /v1/orgs/{id}` does, instead of a 500. `ProjectCreateOutcome`, `ProjectUpdateOutcome`, `TeamCreateOutcome` and `TeamUpdateOutcome` gain `org-not-found`, and so do `CreateProjectError` and `CreateTeamError` (the authorized path). The in-memory bindings check orgs when given `orgExists`.
- 8861bf8: **A registry that takes no writes says so: `409 registry-read-only`.** Under `kindgi dev` the pack's files are the source of agents, tools, flows and guardrails. Writing to them used to answer a misleading `already-registered` (for an agent, even naming a "next free version") or `not found`.
  
  - **The marker:** `AgentRegistryBinding`, `ToolRegistryBinding`, `FlowRegistryBinding` and `GuardrailRegistryBinding` take an optional `readOnly: { reason }` (`RegistryReadOnly`).
  - **What's refused:** every write to a registry that sets it, before the binding is called:
    - publish, unregister and reinstate;
    - deriving an agent version;
    - a deployment that would publish into it.
  - **The refusal:** `409 registry-read-only`, with the binding's reason as the message, e.g. "Under kindgi dev, the pack is the source of agents: edit the pack's file and kindgi dev reloads it." Reads are unchanged.
  - **Clients:** both read `registry-read-only` as a conflict, its code the reason.
  - **CLI:** an error line now shows a conflict's own code, so `kindgi agents publish` prints `Error [registry-read-only]: Under kindgi dev, …`.
- f90c285: A comparison's result is typed in both clients. `openapi.json` names its shape as `JudgedComparisonResult`: the `summary` (`JudgedComparisonSummary`, with `ComparisonCandidate` and each `ComparisonMetric`) and each case (`ComparisonCaseResult`). `EvalRun.result` stays an open object, since each kind of eval run has its own.
  
  The TypeScript client exports the types and `comparisonOf(run)` (also from `@kindgi/sdk/client`), which returns a `judged` eval run's result as `JudgedComparisonResult`, or `undefined` for another kind of run, a dry run, or one not finished. The Python client has `comparison_of(run)`, which returns the validated `models.JudgedComparisonResult`, or `None`.

## 0.1.4-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- c313224: **An agent version is pinned when it's published.** `POST /v1/agents` resolves each of the agent's tool ranges once, to the highest active version the range allows (`pickVersion`). It stores the result on the version as `pins` (`{tools, prompts, settings}`: tool id → exact version) with `pinsDigest` (`sha256:<hex>` of the pins' canonical JSON). Every run of that version uses exactly those tool versions. A new tool version reaches the agent only through a new agent version, and two runs of one agent version always run the same tools.
  
  - **A range that matches no published version refuses the publish:** `400 validation-failed`, with one issue per tool (`/tools/<i>/version`, "publish the tool first").
  - **Pins are set by the runtime, never authored.** `defineAgent` doesn't take them, and a publish body's `pins` is ignored.
  - **`GET /v1/agents/:id/versions/:version` returns `pins` and `pinsDigest`**, as do both clients. Python adds `pins_digest()` in `kindgi.client`, which gives the same string as `pinsDigest()` in `@kindgi/agents`.
  - **Unchanged:** a version published before pins, or by a runtime without a tool registry, has no pins and resolves its ranges per run. `agentsRouter` takes the tool binding as an optional third argument, and `createApp` passes its `toolRegistry`.
- 024a47f: **An agent's prompt and settings can come from data blocks, pinned when the agent version is published.**
  
  - **References:**
    - `instructions` is the system prompt, or a prompt block by range: `{ prompt: 'acme.intake-prompt', version: '^1.0.0' }`. Its template and declared parameters are used instead.
    - `settings: [{ id, version }]` lists settings blocks.
    - `modelSettings: { id, version }` names a model-settings block (`MODEL_SETTINGS_SCHEMA`: `temperature`, `maxOutputTokens`).
  - **Pinned at publish:** `POST /v1/agents` and deploys resolve each reference by `pickVersion` into `pins.prompts` / `pins.settings`, alongside the tools.
  - **Refusals:** a reference that matches no published version, names a block of the other kind, names model settings that aren't, or runs on a runtime with no block registry refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`).
  - **At run time:** a turn loads each block at its pinned version. A resumed turn uses the versions its `setup` journaled (`blockVersions`).
    - The prompt block renders as the instructions.
    - Settings values reach tools as `ToolContext.settings['<id>']` and templates as `settings["<id>"]`.
    - Model settings go into the model call.
    - A block that can't load fails the turn (`block-unresolvable`).
    - `InvokeAgentBindings` takes an optional `blockReader`.
  - **Changed elsewhere:** the agent spec, the pack index, both indexers (TS and Python: `Agent(instructions={...}, settings=[...], model_settings={...})`), and both clients.
  - **Pack protocol 2.4.0:** `callContext` gets optional `settings`, so pack code reads them: `ctx.settings['acme.weights']` in TS, `ctx.settings["acme.weights"]` in Python. Older pack services still answer calls that carry it: a TS one passes it to the handler, a Python one drops it.
  - **`settings` is now a reserved template name.**
- 6260a59: **`GET /v1/blocks` narrows by project or org like the other lists:** `?scopeKind=project&scopeId=<id>` or `?scopeKind=org&scopeId=<id>`, in place of `?projectId=`. A malformed scope answers `400 scope-invalid`.
  
  - `BlockListInput.scope` (a `Scope`) replaces `projectId`. A block store lists the blocks of the project, of every project in the org, or of the whole tenant.
  - TS: `client.blocks.list({ scope: { kind: 'project', projectId } })`.
  - Python: `client.blocks.list(scope_kind='project', scope_id=...)`.
  - `kindgi blocks list --project=<id>` is unchanged.
- d0ebeb6: Comparison eval runs: an agent version run on a test set, beside the recorded runs.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:**
    - **Starting the run.** `POST /v1/eval-suites/{suiteId}/runs` on a `judged` suite (a test set) is a comparison. `agentRef` with its `version` is the candidate. The new body fields are `baseline` (default `'recorded'`), `reads` (`recorded` or `live`), `repetitions` (1–10) and `k` (1–100), and the run keeps them as `comparison`. Only `baseline: 'recorded'` runs today; `{ agentId, version }` and `{ live: … }` are accepted by the contract and refused when the run starts.
    - **The dispatcher.** `createJudgedDispatcher({ cases })` replays each case on the candidate. It goes through the subject invoker, with `replay: { of, evalRunId }` and the case's history, so the replay does nothing the past run didn't. It scores the candidate's output items against the judgments.
    - **Matching items.** A judgment carries over to the same item: the same own id, or, for the answer and elements without an id, the same content.
    - **The result.** `result.summary` (`JudgedComparisonSummary`) has:
      - the baseline (the versions behind the recorded runs) and the candidate;
      - `cases`, `diverged` (a read with no recording ran live), `refusedWrites` and `errors`;
      - the models that answered;
      - `metrics`: `weightedYesShare`, `judgedCoverage` and `weightedPrecisionAtK`, each with the baseline, candidate and delta and the evidence on both sides (`n`, `weight`, `baselineN`, `baselineWeight`), plus `k` and `spread`.
  
      `result.perCase` has each case's replay runs, the items kept, dropped and new, and its tool calls.
    - **Exports.** The item functions (`outputItems`, `matchJudged`, `scoreItems`, `itemChanges`) are exported. Test sets record the project their judgments came from (`spec.projectId`).
  - **`@kindgi/client`:** `evalRuns.start` takes the new fields, and the Python client does too.
  - **`@kindgi/cli`:** `kindgi eval-runs start | show | list | cancel`. `start` takes `--agent` with `--agent-version` (or `--flow`), `--baseline`, `--reads`, `--repetitions`, `--k`, `--dry-run` and `--wait`.
- a311b81: `GET /v1/cost/aggregate` returns at most 1000 groups by default: the most expensive ones. `groups` is ordered by `totalUsd`, highest first (ties by key, groups with no value last); before, the order was undefined and every group came back in one response, one per run for `groupBy=runId` over a long window. `?limit=` takes 1 to 10000 (anything else is `400 bad-input`). The response says when groups were left out: `truncated: true` and `totalGroups`, the count before the cap. `totalUsd`, `totalRecords` and `tokens` still cover every record. For every record, page through `/v1/cost/records`. **A caller that gets more than 1000 groups today gets 1000, with `truncated: true`**, unless it passes a larger `limit`. A `CostBinding` may cap in its own query (`CostAggregateInput.limit`, returning `totalGroups`); one that returns every group is capped by the route. `@kindgi/api` exports `COST_AGGREGATE_DEFAULT_LIMIT` and `COST_AGGREGATE_MAX_LIMIT`. The TypeScript and Python clients take `limit`.
- a0652ac: **Data blocks: versioned prompts and settings an agent version will pin.** A block is published like a tool: immutable versions, soft unregister and reinstate. It belongs to one project.
  
  - **Kinds:**
    - `prompt`: a Liquid template with declared parameters, rendered as an agent's instructions are.
    - `settings`: a JSON object, optionally with a JSON Schema. Its values must satisfy it, and so must a later version's.
  - **`@kindgi/api` adds `/v1/blocks`:** list (latest of each; `kind`, `name`, `projectId` filters), get, versions (`includeTombstoned`), a version, publish, unregister and reinstate. It's mounted when `createApp` gets a `blockRegistry` (`BlockRegistryBinding`).
  - **Authorization goes through the block's project:** `read` to read, `write` to publish, unregister or reinstate. A block the caller can't read answers 404.
  - **Refusals:**
    - a block's kind never changes;
    - a block's versions stay in its first version's project (`409 block-project-mismatch`);
    - a taken version is `409 block-already-registered`.
  - **`@kindgi/agents` adds** `validateBlock()`, `settingsSchemaIssues()` and the block types.
  - **Clients:** `@kindgi/client` adds `client.blocks`, and the Python client has the same resource.
  - **`@kindgi/cli` adds** `kindgi blocks list | show | versions | publish | unregister | reinstate`. `publish` takes `--prompt=@<file>`, `--settings=<json>|@<file>` with `--schema`, or a full definition as JSON.
- fa6680c: **A deploy pins its agents and never keeps a version's old pins.** `POST /v1/deployments` pins each agent as `POST /v1/agents` does. A deploy registers an agent under the version its definition names. When that version is already registered with other pins or content (versions never change), the deploy registers the next free version in its line instead (`1.4.0` → `1.4.1`, `1.4.0-rc.1` → `1.4.0-rc.2`). A deploy never refuses a routine deploy over this.
  
  - **Why a new version:**
    - `pins-changed`: a tool the agent uses has a new version in range.
    - `unpinned`: the version was published before pins existed.
    - `version-taken`: the number is registered with another definition.
  - **Redeploys are idempotent.** A redeploy finds the version an earlier deploy registered for the same definition and pins.
  - **The record:**
    - The registered version records `derivedFrom: {version, reason}`.
    - The deployment's `contents.agents` names each agent's registered `version`. Where it differs from the definition's, it also gives `authoredVersion`, `reason`, `newVersion` and `pinChanges`.
  - **`kindgi deploy` prints one line per such agent:** `agent acme.matcher: registered new version 1.4.1 (1.4.0's pins changed: tool acme.score 1.0.0 → 1.1.0); set version: '1.4.1' in acme.matcher to match`.
  - **A range that matches no published version refuses the deploy:** `400 validation-failed`, with one issue per tool (`/agents/<i>/tools/<j>/version`), and the deploy's tools are rolled back.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `pinChanges()` and the `AgentDerivation` and `PinChange` types.
    - `@kindgi/tools`: `nextVersion()`.
- fac7472: **Derive an agent version with new data-block pins, with no code change.** An expert edits a prompt or settings block and publishes a new version of it; deriving an agent version is how that edit reaches the agent.
  
  - **`POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/versions`** `{ from, pins: { prompts?, settings? }, label?, projectId? }`:
    - The new version is `from` with the named pins swapped, everything else kept.
    - It's numbered the next free patch after the agent's highest version (versions never change).
    - It records `derivedFrom: { version, reason: 'edited', label?, by: 'user:<id>' }`.
    - Answers `201` with the new agent version.
    - Needs `publish` on the agent.
  - **Refusals** (`400 validation-failed`, naming each problem under `details.issues`):
    - a version published before pins;
    - a block the version doesn't already reference (adding one is a code change);
    - a block version that isn't published, is unregistered, is the wrong kind, or isn't model settings for the model-settings block;
    - swaps that change nothing.
    - Tool pins can't be swapped: they come from code.
    - An unknown version answers `404 agent-not-found`.
  - **Clients:**
    - TS: `client.agents.versions.derive(agentId, { from, pins, label })`.
    - Python: `client.agents.derive_version(agent_id, from_=..., pins=...)`.
    - CLI: `kindgi agents derive <agent-id> --from=<semver> --prompt=<block-id>=<version> --setting=<block-id>=<version> [--label=<text>]`. Repeat `--prompt` and `--setting` for several blocks.
  - **A taken number is never overwritten.** `POST /v1/agents` with a version that's already registered (a derived version may hold it) still answers `409 agent-already-registered`. It now names the next free version in the message and as `nextFreeVersion`: `… is already registered, and versions never change; publish it as 1.4.2, the next free version`.
  - **Deploys:** a deploy whose definition and pins match a derived version reuses it, reporting the deploy's own reason (`pins-changed`), not `edited`.
  - **`VersionDerivation`:** `reason` adds `'edited'`; new optional `label` and `by`.
- d3dffb5: Comparison eval runs take a flow version as the candidate. On a test set built from a flow's judged runs, `POST /v1/eval-suites/{suiteId}/runs` with `flowRef: { flowId, version }` replays each case on that flow version (from the past run's input) and scores the flow's whole output against the judgments.
  
  A replayed flow stops at a tool call the replay refuses (a write the past run didn't make), so no made-up value reaches its next step. The case ends `stopped`, with what it would have done. It isn't an error and is left out of the metrics. The summary counts these cases in `stopped`, next to `errors`, and the run's status stays `completed` when cases only stopped.
  
  The summary's `candidate` now says what ran, `{ kind: 'agent', agentId, version }` or `{ kind: 'flow', flowId, version }`, and `baseline.versions` names a flow's recorded versions as `{ flowId, version, cases }`. The subject invoker reports a stop through `EvalRunSubjectInvokeOutcome.stopped`.
- 26b2a23: **A flow version is pinned when it's published, as an agent version is.** `POST /v1/flows` pins each tool the flow runs to its latest active version: tool nodes, fanout branches, and nodes in loop bodies. It also pins each agent the flow runs at no named version (an agent node without `config.version`). The result is stored on the version as `pins` (`{tools, agents}`) with `pinsDigest`, and every run of that flow version uses those versions. A new tool or agent version reaches the flow only through a new flow version. An agent node with its own `config.version` keeps it.
  
  - **Refusals:** a tool or agent with no published version refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`, naming each).
  - **Deploys** pin flows after agents and follow the same rule as agents, from one shared code path. When pins change, the deploy registers the next free version with `derivedFrom`, and a redeploy is idempotent. So one tool change cascades through an agent into a flow within a single deploy, each derived once. The deployment's `contents.flows` names each flow's registered version (`DeployedVersion`), and `kindgi deploy` prints one line per renumbered flow.
  - **Unchanged:** a flow version published before pins binds the latest versions per run, as before.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/flow`: `FlowPins`, `flowPinsDigest()` and `flowRefs()`.
    - `@kindgi/types`: `VersionDerivation`.
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `PinChange.kind` adds `agent`, and `pinChanges()` takes any pin set. `withVersions(flow, { tools?, agents? })` (`@kindgi/flow`) runs a flow version with some blocks at other exact versions through the same pins: what a comparison or replay runs, with `pinsDigest` recomputed.
- b67eee6: A judged flow run keeps what it did, so it can be replayed later. At a flow run's first judgment, its run copy's `context.flow` keeps:
  - every tool call the run made, with its result: at its tool nodes (per loop iteration), in its agent steps' turns, and in its sub-flows (at most 500, with `truncated`);
  - its agent steps (each turn's agent, version and what it retrieved).
  
  `createApp` passes its `flowRegistry` to the judgments routes to tell tool nodes apart. The capture is best effort: a part that can't be read is left out, and the judgment never fails over it. Judging a run needs `write` on the run's project (the route's own description now says so).
- 7a8e764: A duplicate org, team or project slug is a `409 slug-conflict`, not a `500`. `POST /v1/orgs`, `/v1/teams` and `/v1/projects` with a slug the tenant already has, and a `PATCH` to one, answered `500`; now `409 slug-conflict` (`Another project in the tenant has the slug "acme"`, with `details: { resource, slug }`), whether or not the deployment enforces authorization. A second Default project is `409 project-default-already-exists`. A `PATCH` of a missing org, team or project, a member added to a team or project deleted mid-request, and a role change for a non-member answer their `404`s from the binding's outcome instead of matching an error message. The TypeScript and Python clients read both new codes as a conflict (`ConflictError` in Python).
  
  **Breaking for custom platform bindings.** `OrgBinding`, `TeamBinding`, `ProjectBinding`, `TeamMembershipBinding` and `ProjectMembershipBinding` writes no longer reject for a caller mistake; they resolve to an outcome discriminated on `kind`: `create` to `{ kind: 'ok', orgId | teamId | projectId }`, `slug-conflict` or (projects) `project-default-already-exists`; `update` to `ok`, `*-not-found` or `slug-conflict`; a membership's `add` and `updateRole` to `ok`, `team-not-found` / `project-not-found` or `*-membership-not-found`. The types are exported (`OrgCreateOutcome`, `ProjectUpdateOutcome`, …). The in-memory bindings keep slugs unique within a tenant. `TenantHierarchyBinding.addTeamMember` / `addProjectMember` fail with `AddTeamMemberError` / `AddProjectMemberError` (`team-not-found` / `project-not-found`, or `add-failed`), which replace `MembershipMutationError`. A binding of your own needs the same changes; the conformance suites in `@kindgi/platform`'s `tests/` check them.
- a0921a1: Test sets built from judgments, and context captured when a run is first judged. `@kindgi/api` adds the `judged` eval kind, `POST /v1/eval-suites/{suiteId}/versions/from-judgments` (publishes a version whose cases are copies of an agent's or flow's judged runs, each item's judgments summed and weighted by judge class) and `GET /v1/eval-suites/{suiteId}/versions/{version}/cases`, mounted when `createApp` gets an `evalCaseStore` (`EvalCaseStoreBinding`) beside `evalSuiteRegistry` and `judgmentRegistry`; a `JudgmentRegistryBinding` adds `listJudgedRuns` to support it. The first judgment of an agent turn also stores `context` on the run copy: the conversation before the turn and what its retrievals returned. `@kindgi/client` adds `evalSuites.buildFromJudgments` and `evalSuites.listCases`; the Python client has the same methods. `@kindgi/cli` adds `kindgi eval-suites list | show | from-judgments | cases`.
- d9cee7c: Judging a run needs `write` on the run's project, as cancelling one does: a run inherits its permissions from its project. With authorization on, judging was refused for every run, because it asked for a `judge` permission on the run itself, which no run has. The unreleased `judge` action is gone from `@kindgi/authz`.
- dde7fdb: Judgments and judge classes. A judgment is a yes or no, with an optional reason, about one item of a finished run's output, optionally recorded under a judge class that carries a weight. `@kindgi/api` adds `/v1/judgments` (create, list, get, unregister) and `/v1/judge-classes` (create, list, get, update, unregister), mounted when `createApp` gets a `judgmentRegistry` (`JudgmentRegistryBinding`). A judgment keeps copies of the run's input and output and of the judged item, takes who judged from the caller's token, and judging an item again as the same caller supersedes the earlier judgment. `@kindgi/authz` adds the `judge` action on `run`. `@kindgi/policy-contract` adds the `judgment` and `judge_class` retention domains. `@kindgi/client` adds `client.judgments` and `client.judgeClasses`; the Python client has the same resources. `@kindgi/cli` adds `kindgi judgments add | list | show | remove` and `kindgi judge-classes list | add | set | remove`.
- e17b230: Deleting an org is a tombstone, and `org` is a retention domain. `OrgBinding.delete` no longer erases the org: from then on `get`, `list` and `update` treat it as unknown, and its slug is free for a new org, as before; a retention policy on `org` (new in `RETENTION_DOMAINS`) purges the row. The in-memory binding tombstones too, and the conformance suite checks that a deleted org is unknown to every read, frees its slug, and can be deleted again. `DELETE /v1/orgs/{orgId}` describes what the Kindgi runtime does: the org's projects and teams stay, without an org; the org's own secrets and secret mappings are deleted with it, for good; its own environments and MCP endpoints are unregistered.
- 3d23304: A project's slug is unique within its org, not the whole tenant: two orgs may each have a project called `intake`. A project without an org has a slug unique among the tenant's projects without one. An org's and a team's slug stay unique in the tenant.
  
  - **`409 slug-conflict`** on `POST /v1/projects` when the org already has the slug. `PATCH /v1/projects/:id` answers it for a new slug, and now also for a move to another org (`orgId`, or `null` for none) where the slug is taken. The message says where: "Another project in its org has the slug …".
  - **Deleting an org** leaves its projects without an org. When one of them has the slug of a project that has none, `DELETE /v1/orgs/:id` deletes nothing and answers `409 slug-conflict` naming the slugs (`details.slugs`); rename or move those projects first. `OrgBinding.delete` may return `{ kind: 'slug-conflict', slugs }` (`OrgDeleteConflict`). A binding that returns nothing deletes as before.
  - The in-memory `ProjectBinding` checks slugs per org, and the binding conformance suite pins the per-org cases.
- 2923703: A provider can carry labels, and `provider` is a retention domain.
  
  - **`ProviderMetadata.labels`**, optional: string keys to string values, for bookkeeping such as who manages the provider. The router ignores them. `POST /v1/providers` stores them, and get and list return them. At most 32 keys; a key is 1-63 lowercase letters and digits, with `.`, `-`, `_` or `/` inside; a value is at most 256 characters. Anything else is `400 invalid-provider` with reason `invalid-labels`, and `createProviderRegistry` refuses the same labels. The convention key `kindgi.com/managed-by` (`PROVIDER_LABEL_MANAGED_BY`) names the manager: `kindgi-dev`, `kindgi-dev:<pack id>` or `kindgi-deploy:<environment>`. `@kindgi/capabilities` exports `validateProviderLabels` and the limits. The TypeScript and Python clients have the field.
  - **`provider` in `RETENTION_DOMAINS`.** `ProviderRegistryBinding.unregister` is a tombstone, not an erase: the provider is gone from list, get, capabilities and routing at once, its id is free to register again, and a retention policy on `provider` purges the row. A runtime that still erases on unregister behaves the same through the API.
- bfeabfd: Publishing a policy that nothing applies is refused. `access-control`, `adapter-allowlist`, `rate-limit` and `compliance` are known policy kinds, but no runtime consumer applies them yet, so publishing one changed nothing, silently. `POST /v1/policies` now answers `400 kind-not-applied` for them, naming the kinds it does apply in `details.appliedKinds` (`model-routing`, `retention`, `tool-errors`, `hitl`). Policies of those kinds already stored stay readable, and the list still filters by them. `@kindgi/policy-contract` exports `APPLIED_POLICY_KINDS` and `isAppliedPolicyKind`; `@kindgi/api` re-exports `APPLIED_POLICY_KINDS`.
- d0ebeb6: Replay turns: an agent turn can re-run a past run for an eval run without doing anything the past run didn't do.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - `InvokeAgentInput.replay` (`{ of, evalRunId }`) marks a turn as a replay. It is kept on the turn's run and in its run snapshot (new nullable `agent_run_snapshots.replay` column), so a resumed turn stays a replay.
    - The new optional `InvokeAgentBindings.replay` (`ReplayBinding`) decides each tool call:
      - `live`: the tool runs;
      - `recorded`: the past run's result is used;
      - `refused`: the model gets the given result.
    - Whatever the binding says, only a tool declared read-only (`mutating: false`, no writing effect, see `isReadOnlyTool`) with no approval to wait for runs. A replay with no binding refuses every call.
    - Each decision is journaled, and `AgentTurnResult.replay` lists them. A refused call shows what the turn would have done.
    - `retrievals` can supply the past run's retrieved facts. `sessionApproval` gives the past run's decision at the session approval gate, which the replay follows (a recorded rejection fails the turn with `hitl-rejected`). Without a recorded decision the gate is skipped, and the result says so.
    - `tool.completed` events carry `replay: 'live' | 'recorded' | 'refused'`.
  - `@kindgi/runtime`: `RunReplayRef`; `replay` on `runGraph` and `startRun`; `replayOf` and `evalRunId` on `KernelRunRecord`; `replays` and `evalRunId` on `ListRunsInput`.
  - `@kindgi/capabilities`: `ModelUsageRecord.replay` tags a replay's model calls with the past run and the eval run.
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - A run carries `replayOf` and `evalRunId`.
    - `GET /v1/runs` leaves replay runs out unless `replays=include|only`; `evalRunId` lists one eval run's replays.
    - A judged agent turn's captured `context` also keeps `sessionApproval`, the decision at its session approval gate.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `runs.list({ replays, evalRunId })`; the Python client too.
  - `@kindgi/cli`: `kindgi runs list --replays=<exclude|include|only> --eval-run=<id>`.
- 62608e3: **Unregister stops a version being chosen, not the pins that hold it.**
  
  - **Retired tool versions.** `createToolRegistry().register(tool, { retired: true })` keeps an unregistered tool version for the published agent and flow versions that pin it.
    - Only its exact version (`getVersion`, `hasVersion`) reaches it.
    - `resolve` (a range), `get` (latest), `list`, `versions`, `has` and `ids` skip it.
  - **A pinned turn reaches it.** A turn resolves a pinned tool by its exact version, so a published agent version pinned to a retired tool version keeps running it. A range never picks one.
  - **`getVersion` reads unregistered versions.** `AgentRegistryBinding.getVersion` and `FlowRegistryBinding.getVersion` return them too (`AgentVersionRecord`, `FlowVersionRecord`, with `unregisteredAt`). `GET /v1/agents/:id/versions/:version` and `GET /v1/flows/:id/versions/:version` return `unregisteredAt`.
  - **Who reads what:** a resumed run, provenance, and a flow version that pins an agent version read unregistered versions. A new run that names one is refused by the runtime.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 2544717: An approval says who decided it, after the decision: on the API, in the run's journal, and in the turn's provenance.
  
  - **API.** `GET /v1/approvals/:id` and `GET /v1/approvals` carry an approval's recorded `decision` (`ApprovalDecisionRecord`): `decision`, `rationale`, `reviewerId`, `reviewerRoleAtDecision`, `decidedAt` and `decidedBy`, the decider as an actor, `user:<userId>`. An open approval, or one that ended without a decision (expired, or escalated by a timeout), has none. The TypeScript client types it (`Approval.decision`, `ApprovalDecisionRecord`), and the Python client models it.
  - **Journal.** `POST /v1/approvals/:id/complete` resumes the run with `{ decided, rationale?, decidedBy, approvalId }` (`GateDecisionValue`, exported by `@kindgi/agents`), so the run's journal records who decided which approval. `readGateDecision` reads `decidedBy` and `approvalId` when they're there; a value without them still decides. Another subject's explicit `value` is resumed as given.
  - **Provenance.** A tool call that waited on an approval has a `wait` node (`tool-hitl-gate-wait:<invocationId>`, the agent parked, at the time it parked) `resumed-from` a `resume` node (`tool-hitl-gate-resume:<invocationId>`, at the time the decision came; its `actor` is whoever decided, and its attributes the decision, rationale and `approvalId`). The call `waited-on` the wait, and its result was `caused-by` the resume. A resumed turn reads them from its journal, so every call shows its approval, those decided before an earlier park too. The session gate's `resume` node names whoever decided as its `actor` (the agent, for a decision recorded before it was named), with the `approvalId`.
  - **For a custom `HitlBinding`:** return each approval's `decision` from `getApproval` and `listApprovals`, with `ReviewDecisionRecord.decidedBy`, for them to show; both are optional, and a binding without them answers as before.
- 0f226c2: An agent's approval gates fail closed. A tool-call approval rejected with a `value` still ran the tool: `POST /v1/approvals/:id/complete` let a `value` replace the resume payload `{ decided, rationale }`, and the tool and session gates went on unless they read an explicit `reject`. Now only an explicit approve lets a tool run or a session go on; a reject, or an answer that isn't a decision at all, blocks, the tool call with a rejected result that says why. And the route refuses a `value` for an agent's tool-call or session gate (`tool-call:pending`, `agent-turn:session-hitl-gate`) with `400 bad-input`, before anything is recorded; another subject's approval still takes one. `@kindgi/agents` exports the gate subjects (`AGENT_GATE_SUBJECTS`, `TOOL_CALL_GATE_SUBJECT`, `SESSION_GATE_SUBJECT`) and `readGateDecision`.
- 629057d: Every model call is recorded, with everything the provider says about it, and the cost API reads it per call, per run tree, and per org.
  
  - **Usage recording.** The agent turn records each model call in a usage sink (`InvokeAgentBindings.usage`, `UsageSink` / `ModelUsageRecord` in `@kindgi/capabilities`) before the step goes on, a call that threw included. The record carries the call id, project, run, agent and version, conversation, step, provider, the model actually called, a fallback flag, status, usage, duration and finish reason; a failed call's error carries the attempts it took. llm-judge guardrails record theirs too (`EvaluationBindings.usage`, `purpose: guardrail-judge:<id>`, with the turn's step and agent version). A dry run records nothing.
  - **A sink that fails** is tried again (`recordModelUsage`; a record is idempotent by call id). An answered call it still can't record fails the step with `persistence-error` (an llm-judge's is `judge-usage-unrecorded`, which the turn fails on the same way). A failed call keeps its own failure, and says when it couldn't be recorded either.
  - **Usage, unfolded.** `UsageCounters` reports the parts of its totals: `cacheReadTokens` and `cacheWriteTokens` are parts of `promptTokens`, `reasoningTokens` of `completionTokens`. A part is there when the provider reports it, a reported 0 included, and absent when it doesn't. `ModelCallResult` adds `servedModel` (the exact version the vendor reports), `providerRequestId`, `attempts` (HTTP attempts, the SDK's own retries included, counted with `createAttemptCounter` from `@kindgi/capabilities/attempts`, a Node-only entry; a call that throws keeps its own error, and `attemptsOf(error)` gives its attempts) and `rawUsage` (the vendor's usage object as it reported it). The Anthropic, Gemini and OpenAI-compatible adapters fill them.
  - **Breaking, for a custom model adapter:** `UsageCounters.cachedTokens` is renamed `cacheReadTokens`.
  - **Breaking, for a custom `CostBinding`:** `tokens` is required on `CostAggregateGroup` and `CostAggregateResult`, and a binding that can't read should throw (the API answers 500) rather than return an empty page.
  - **Cost API (`@kindgi/api`, `@kindgi/client`).** A cost record of a model call carries `callId`, `projectId`, `rootRunId`, `parentRunId`, `agentVersion`, `flowId`, `nodeId`, `step`, `purpose`, `model`, `servedModel`, `fallback`, `status`, `usage`, `durationMs`, `finishReason`, `providerRequestId`, `attempts` and `error`, and `rawUsage` with `include=rawUsage`. New filters: `model`, `servedModel`, `rootRunId`, `includeDescendants` (with `runId`). New `groupBy` dimensions: `model`, `servedModel`, `projectId`, `orgId`, `rootRunId`, `flowId`. Every aggregate group and the total carry `tokens: {prompt, completion, cacheRead, cacheWrite, reasoning}`. A binding that fails answers 500, never an empty page. `to` is exclusive, as the binding always applied it. The TypeScript client takes `scope`, the new filters and `includeRawUsage`.
  - **`run.finished`** carries `usage: {calls, costUsd, tokens}` (`RunTreeUsage`) for the run tree, when the runtime records usage: what the ledger had recorded when the run finished, failed calls counted (a child run still running then isn't in it).
  - **Clients:** `includeDescendants` is a boolean query parameter; the Python client names a cost record's error `ModelCallError`.
  - **Provenance (breaking for readers of `model-call` attributes):** a `model-call` node keeps the call's identity (`callId`, `providerId`, `model`, `finishReason`, `step`); its `promptTokens`, `completionTokens` and `costUsd` are gone from `attributes`. A provenance read carries them in `callUsage`, by `callId`, from the cost ledger, outside the signed DAG (`ProvenanceBinding.getCallUsage`). A signed export includes `callUsage` as it stood when signed (bundle schema `1.1.0`).
- 1463b77: Approvals, conversations and provenance list by project, as runs do. `GET /v1/approvals`, `GET /v1/conversations` and `GET /v1/provenance` take `scopeKind=project|org` + `scopeId`: one project's records, or every project's in an org. A `scopeId` that isn't a UUID is `400 scope-invalid`. The records say their project:
  - an agent's approvals are enqueued in the turn's project (`HitlEnqueueInput.projectId`);
  - a conversation has `projectId`, set by the run that opens it or by `POST /v1/conversations`' new `projectId` (one of the tenant's projects, else `400 bad-input`; omitted, the tenant's Default project, as for a run); `agent_conversations` gets a nullable `project_id` (migration `0003`);
  - a provenance record's list row has `projectId`, which the emitter passes beside the signed document (`ProvenanceEmitBinding.emit(provenance, { projectId })`).
  
  `ListScope` (`@kindgi/types`) is the scope of each binding's list input. TypeScript client: `scope` on `approvals.list`, `conversations.list` and `provenance.query`, and `projectId` on `conversations.open`; the Python client takes `scope_kind` / `scope_id` and `project_id` (regenerated). Records from before this release have no project, so only a list without a scope shows them (nothing is backfilled).
- 453056f: A registered reviewer can use the approvals surface with any token of theirs. The approvals routes refused every token that didn't carry a `reviewerRole` itself, so a reviewer signed in through OAuth, or calling with an API key, got 403 on `/v1/approvals`. Now a token with no role of its own takes the role the reviewer roster gives its user (`ReviewerBinding.resolveReviewerRole`), and `GET /v1/identity/whoami` reports the same role. A token with no user, or a user who isn't a reviewer, is still refused, and the 403 says how to register one (`kindgi reviewers register`).
  
  - **For a custom `ReviewerBinding`:** implement the new optional `resolveReviewerRole({ tenantId, userId })` (the user's reviewer role in the tenant, or `null`) for its reviewers' sessions and API keys to work; without it, only a token that carries its role reviews, as before.
- 6bae409: An agent's turn names its agent. The run record of an agent run, and of the turn a flow's agent step starts, carries `agent`: the agent's id, the version that ran and the conversation (`RunAgentRef` in `@kindgi/runtime`, `Run.agent` on the wire, the `RunAgent` schema). `GET /v1/runs?agentId=` lists one agent's turns, at every version; it combines with the scope, `topLevel` and the cursor. The TypeScript client takes `runs.list({ agentId })`; the Python client `runs.list(agent_id=…)`. Turns that ran before this release don't name their agent: they have no `agent` and aren't listed by `agentId`.
- ab23a9b: A run id that isn't one is a 400. `GET /v1/runs/not-a-uuid` (and the run's `progress`, `journal`, `stream`, `progress/stream` and `cancel`) answered `500`, from the database's uuid cast; now `400 bad-input` "`runId` must be a run id (a UUID)", before any query. A `parentRunId` filter that isn't a run id is a 400 too. And the OpenAPI `runs.list` operation declares the `scopeKind` / `scopeId` filter it already took: `ListRunsFilter.scope` in the TypeScript client and `scope_kind` / `scope_id` in the Python client list one project's runs, or every project's in an org. The TypeScript client's scopes (runs, cost, env, secrets, MCP endpoints) take a `ScopeRef`: `{ kind: 'project', projectId }` or `{ kind: 'org', orgId }`, with no `tenantId` needed (the API takes the tenant from the token; a `Scope` with one still fits).
- 6c274dd: `GET /v1/runs?scopeKind=project|org&scopeId=…` with a `scopeId` that isn't a UUID is `400 scope-invalid` ("scope query parameters malformed: scopeId must be a project id (a UUID), got …"), before any query; it reached the database's uuid cast and failed there. The runs list now reads its scope as approvals, conversations and provenance do.
- 2c185d8: Fixes from the first Cloud Run deployment.
  
  - **The pack service token is read the same way on both sides.** `parsePackServiceToken` (new in `@kindgi/env-schema`) drops surrounding whitespace, so a secret stored with a trailing newline no longer makes every pack call answer 401. A token with whitespace or a control character inside is refused at startup, since an HTTP header can't carry it. The Node pack service and the Python one (`kindgi.pack.serve`) both use the rule, and the pack conformance suite checks it.
  - **Refusals aren't replayed.** The idempotency middleware stores a response only when the request took effect (a status below 400). A request retried with the same `Idempotency-Key` after a refusal (4xx) or a failure (5xx) runs again, so a deploy retried after trusting its key now goes through.
  - **`kindgi deploy` says when an answer is a replay** (`X-Idempotent-Replay`) and how to retry: `--idempotency-key <new value>` for a replayed refusal from an older runtime. A refused signing key's hint gives the `kindgi key trust <keyId> --url <endpoint>` command on a line of its own. The retry advice for server errors and network failures is reworded.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- 610a9de: `@kindgi/agents` uses drizzle-orm 0.45.3, which fixes how SQL identifiers are escaped (GHSA-gpj5-g38j-94v9). Kindgi's schema uses fixed identifiers only, so it wasn't exploitable through Kindgi. `@kindgi/api` no longer depends on drizzle-orm, which it never used.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 786ea98: An exception a route throws now reaches the client as a `500 internal-server-error` wire error, as JSON with its message and the request id. Before, Hono's own error handler answered first with plain-text "Internal Server Error", so the JSON error mapper never ran and clients got an unparseable 500. The mapping is now the app's error handler (`app.onError`); an exception that carries its own response (Hono's `HTTPException`) still answers with it.
- 324aba4: **`POST /v1/runs/{runId}/resume` is not available in this release.** It now answers `422 run-resume-not-supported` and completes nothing. Every waitpoint a run can wait at belongs to an approval or to the runtime itself. A run waiting for an approval continues when a reviewer decides it, through `POST /v1/approvals/{approvalId}/complete` (`kindgi approvals complete`), which checks the reviewer and records the decision. `kindgi runs resume` says the same and is left out of `--help`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: API keys are service accounts with a role and capabilities, and they can be listed.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:**
    - `POST /v1/tokens` takes `role` (`admin` | `member`, default `member`) and `capabilities`.
      - Only a tenant admin can mint (`admin` on the tenant with authorization on, otherwise the `tenant-admin` scope), and only capabilities the caller holds can be granted.
      - The response is the key's record plus its `token`, shown once.
    - New `GET /v1/tokens` (paged, newest first) and `GET /v1/tokens/{tokenId}`. They're tenant-admin only and never return secrets. Revoke is tenant-admin only too.
    - `TokenAdmin` gains `list` and `get`. `mint` takes `role`, `capabilities` and `createdBy`, and returns `{ record, token }`. New types: `ApiTokenRecord`, `ApiTokenRole`, `API_TOKEN_ROLES`.
    - `TokenResolution.tokenId` is a durable key's id. The principal is then `service_account:<tokenId>`, and it wins over a session id.
  - **`@kindgi/client`:**
    - `tokens.create(spec?)` sends `role`, `capabilities`, `label`, `expiresAt` and `projectId`, and returns the server's record. `ApiTokenSpec` and `ApiToken` drop `name`/`scopes` for `label`/`role`/`capabilities`.
    - `tokens.list({ limit, cursor })` and `tokens.get(id)` are wired.
    - The unwired `tokens.scopes()` and `TokenScope` are gone.
- aec851d: A deployment's tools and guardrails keep where their code is, and the trust list it's verified against gets routes.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`, `POST /v1/deployments`:**
    - **What registers is the signed image's index.** The server reads `/app/index.json` from the image, checks it hashes to the signed `indexHash`, and registers what it declares. The request body no longer carries `index`. Before, the route validated and registered the body's copy, which no signature covers, so a replayed request could register tools the image never shipped. The image's index must also name the signed `artifactVersion` (`400 image-unverifiable` otherwise).
    - **The code pointer.** A tool's `modulePath` and a guardrail's `checkModulePath` become `codeArtifactRef: { kind: 'oci', imageRef, modulePath, artifactVersion }`, pointing into the deployed image. Before, they were stripped, so a deployed pack tool had no code the runtime could reach.
    - **What a deployment shipped.** The record gains `contents`: each tool's, agent's and flow's `{ id, version }`, and each guardrail's `{ id }`. `DeploymentRegisterInput` and `Deployment` carry it; it's required, so a `DeploymentBinding` stores it. Versions are immutable and a digest deploys once, so the latest deployment is the live one. A rollback rolls forward: deploy the earlier code again under new versions.
    - **The catalog caches hear of it.** A new deployment calls `onToolWrite` / `onGuardrailWrite` for each tool and guardrail it registered, as `POST /v1/tools` and `POST /v1/guardrails` do, so a runtime's tool and guardrail bridges see it at once. `DeploymentContents` and `DeployedPrimitive` are exported.
    - **Indexed guardrails deploy.** A guardrail's `checkId` becomes its `check`, and the index-only `configSchema` is dropped, as `kindgi dev` maps them. Before, every guardrail the indexer writes failed validation.
  - **`@kindgi/api`, `/v1/signing-keys`:** the tenant's trusted signing keys, the public keys whose deployments verify. Mounted when `signingKeyRegistry` is passed, on its own, without the deployments route.
    - `POST /v1/signing-keys` trusts a key: `keyId`, `publicKey` (base64 Ed25519), `label?`. It returns `201`, or `200` for the same key again. A known id with another key is `409 signing-key-conflict`; rotate under a new id.
    - `GET /v1/signing-keys` lists the active keys (`?includeRevoked=true`, `?label=` prefix). `GET /v1/signing-keys/{keyId}` returns one key, revoked or not.
    - `POST /v1/signing-keys/{keyId}/revoke` takes an optional `reason`. A revoked key stays readable for audit and verifies no new deployments.
    - Writes need the `signing-keys:write` capability.
    - Revocation is final: trusting a revoked key id again is `409 signing-key-revoked`.
    - New error codes: `signing-key-conflict` (409), `signing-key-revoked` (409), `signing-key-algorithm-unsupported` (400), `signing-key-store-error` (500).
  - **`@kindgi/client`:** `client.signingKeys` (`trust`, `list`, `get`, `revoke`); `deployments.register` takes no `index`. The Python client's models and resources follow.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** the `image-registry` group, how the server reads deployment images: `KINDGI_IMAGE_REGISTRY_HOST`, `_USERNAME`, `_PASSWORD` (credentials for one host, all three or none) and `_INSECURE_HOSTS` (hosts reached over plain HTTP).
- aec851d: The hooks the runtime needs to guard the server's connections to hosts a tenant chose (T83). The guard itself is in the runtime.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:** `HostReach` gains `'metadata-network'` (link-local addresses, where the cloud metadata endpoints hand out the server's credentials) and `'loopback'` (the server's own host). `KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS=deployed` refuses both, as well as `'exec'`.
  - **`@kindgi/capabilities`:** `AdapterFactoryInput.fetch` is the fetch for a provider endpoint the registration chose.
  - **`@kindgi/adapter-model-openai-compat`:** the factory sends through that fetch.
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:**
    - `defineTool(spec, { synthesizer: { fetch } })` and `ToolSpecSynthesizerOptions`: a declarative HTTP tool's handler sends through the runtime's fetch.
    - `validateToolManifest` now refuses an HTTP tool whose `urlTemplate` puts a `{placeholder}` in the scheme, host or port, or isn't `http(s)://` with a host. Placeholders belong in the path and query, where they're URL-encoded; in the authority, a run's input would pick the host.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS`'s description says what `deployed` refuses.
- aec851d: What a tenant registers can no longer reach the server's own host unless the deployment allows it, and MCP endpoints authenticate through the secrets store.
  
  - **`KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS`** (`@kindgi/env-schema`): `deployed` refuses a `stdio` MCP endpoint, a command the server would run in its container as its user. `local` allows it, for a machine where every token holder may run commands. Unset, it's `local` under `KINDGI_DEV` and `deployed` otherwise.
  - **`@kindgi/api`:**
    - `createApp` takes `tenantHostAccess` (default `deployed`). Under `deployed`, registering a `stdio` endpoint answers `403 host-access-denied`, a new error code.
    - `deniesHostReach`, `parseTenantHostAccess`, `TENANT_HOST_ACCESS_LEVELS` and `stdioRefusal` are exported for the runtime's connect-time check. Checks ask `deniesHostReach(level, reach)`, so a stricter level is one more row.
    - `mcpRouter` takes the level as a fourth argument.
  - **`MCPEndpoint.secretRef: { envName, name }` replaces `authRef`.** It's a secret by name in the deployment's store, resolved at the endpoint's tenant scope, the shape webhooks and providers use.
    - `env:NAME` references, which read the server's own environment, are gone.
    - The register body now refuses unknown fields, so an `authRef` is a `400` (`unknown-field`), not silently dropped.
    - The webhook routes and MCP share one `secretRef` parser.
  - **`@kindgi/client`:** `McpEndpoint` and `RegisterMcpEndpointInput` take `secretRef` (`McpEndpointSecretRef`). The Python `kindgi.client` is regenerated: `secret_ref` replaces `auth_ref`.
- aec851d: A tool reads back the way it was registered: the wire shape carries the whole manifest.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:**
    - `GET /v1/tools`, `GET /v1/tools/{toolId}` and the versions routes now return `mutating`, `sandbox`, `limits`, `network`, `needsSpec`, `codeArtifactRef` (where the code runs: the deployed image and module) and the declarative `spec`. Before, they dropped them, so nothing reading the API could see where a pack tool's code runs or how it's sandboxed. A secret appears only as a reference (`secretRef`), never a value.
    - The `Tool` schema (and `RegisterToolBody`, `ToolVersionRow`) declares those fields. They were accepted and stored already, but undocumented, so a typed client couldn't send them without a cast.
    - New components: `SandboxMode`, `RuntimeLimits`, `NetworkPolicy`, `TypedNeeds`, `CodeArtifactRef`, `ToolSpec`, and the declarative HTTP tool's `HttpToolSpec`, `HttpHeaderSpec`, `HttpAuthSpec`, `HttpRequestBodySpec`, `ToolSecretRef`. Each is a mirror of `@kindgi/specs/tool.schema.json`. The schema drift test now holds Tool's property names, and each of these, equal to the spec.
  - **`@kindgi/client`:** the tool types gain the fields. The Python client's models follow.
- aec851d: Gemini on Vertex AI, and providers that carry their connection settings.
  
  - `@kindgi/adapter-model-gemini` (new): a Gemini `ModelProvider` on Vertex AI, through `@google/genai`.
    - **Credentials:** Google Application Default Credentials (a `gcloud` login on a laptop, the attached service account on Cloud Run), or a service-account key.
    - **Function calling:** tool ids go over the wire unchanged; each call's thought signature is kept and sent back on the next request.
    - **Tokens:** thinking parts are left out of the text, and thinking tokens count as completion.
    - **Cost:** cached-prompt and long-context rates.
    - **For servers:** `geminiAdapterFactory` reads `adapter_config.project`, and uses `metadata.region` as the location.
  - `@kindgi/capabilities`:
    - `AdapterFactoryInput.config` (`AdapterConfig`): an adapter's flat, non-secret connection settings.
    - `ModelToolCall.signature`: an opaque token a provider attaches to a tool call and needs back when the conversation continues.
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `POST /v1/providers` takes `adapter_config`. The binding receives it as `adapterConfig` and returns it from `resolveForRuntime`; `list` and `get` never return it.
    - The OpenAPI `RegisterProviderBody` now describes the actual body, `{ metadata, adapter_id, secret_ref?, adapter_config? }`; it used to describe `ProviderMetadata`.
    - `ProviderCost` allows adapter-specific rate fields.
  - `@kindgi/client`: the generated `RegisterProviderBody` follows.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the providers skill covers Gemini on Vertex, and `adapter_config`. It also notes that the OpenAI-compat adapter isn't registered by the runtime yet.
- aec851d: Fallback providers. `ProviderMetadata.fallback: true` makes a provider serve a capability only when no other provider satisfies it; `route()` then reports `fallback: true`, and a fallback is never an alternate to a regular pick. An agent turn routed to one carries a `fallback-provider` warning (`AgentTurnResult.warnings`). `dev-echo` is a fallback, so registering a real model takes over from it with nothing to switch off — before, ties went to the provider id that sorts first, and `dev-echo` beat `gemini`, `groq` or `ollama`. `POST /v1/providers` accepts and returns `fallback`; the clients carry it. The providers and getting-started skills describe it, and register Anthropic or Gemini with `kindgi providers register --preset` (the CLI's presets).
- aec851d: A runtime can keep a run's state in memory, and publish journal entries in batches.
  
  - `@kindgi/runtime`:
    - `createRunState()`, `applyJournalEntry(state, entry)` and `cloneRunState(state)`.
      - `deriveRunState(journal)` is the fold of the first two.
      - A runtime reads a run's journal once, then applies each entry it writes, instead of reading the journal again.
      - It dispatches against a clone, so a running step sees the run as it was when the step was dispatched.
    - `KernelEventBusBinding.publishMany?(tenantId, channel, docs)` (optional): publish entries that were written together, in one call. The runtime uses it when the binding has it, and `publish` for each entry otherwise.
  - `@kindgi/api`: `EventBusBinding.publishMany?` (optional). It works like `publish` for each doc, with consecutive `seq`s and one notification.
- aec851d: Public run tokens: a browser can follow a run's progress without a secret API token.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `CreateAppInput.publicRunTokens` (`signingKey` + `keyId`, an Ed25519 key; lifetimes; `allowedOrigins`). When set, `POST /v1/runs` returns `publicAccessToken` + `publicAccessTokenExpiresAt` (15 minutes by default), and `POST /v1/tokens/public` mints tokens for up to 50 runs (at most 24 hours).
    - Progress routes: `GET /v1/runs/{runId}/progress` (`RunProgress`: status and timing, no input, output or failure message) and `GET /v1/runs/{runId}/progress/stream` (`RunProgressEvent`: kind, node, sequence, time; no payload). They accept an API token or a public run token. `GET /v1/runs/{runId}` and `/stream` are unchanged and keep requiring an API token.
    - A public run token (`kgi_pt_…`, Ed25519-signed, stateless) is accepted only by the two progress routes (every other route answers 403), for the runs it names and their descendants (others answer 404).
    - The routes a public token may use come from the operation registry (`security: 'bearer-or-public-run'`); the OpenAPI document declares the `publicRunToken` security scheme on them.
    - CORS for `allowedOrigins` on the two progress routes only, ahead of authentication.
    - `mintPublicRunToken` / `verifyPublicRunToken` for deployments that issue tokens themselves.
  - `@kindgi/client`:
    - `subscribeToRun({ apiUrl, runId, accessToken, refreshAccessToken })`: follow a run's progress from a browser with a public token, refreshing it when it expires.
    - `runs.progress`, `runs.streamProgress`, `tokens.createPublic`.
    - `runs.stream` now follows the run to its terminal event: when the server ends the stream at its time limit, it reconnects from the last event instead of ending early. `followRun` is the shared loop; `readSse` takes `lastEventId` and per-attempt `headers`, and throws `SseHttpError` (with `status`) on HTTP errors.
  - `@kindgi/env-schema`: `KINDGI_PUBLIC_TOKEN_SIGNING_KEY_PATH` and `KINDGI_CORS_ORIGINS`.
- aec851d: Runs return their output, record which run started them, and can be started without waiting.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - Run responses (`GET /v1/runs/:runId`, start, cancel, resume) include `output` once the run completed. Lists include it only with `?include=output`.
    - A child run carries `parentRunId` and `parentNodeId`. `GET /v1/runs` filters with `?parentRunId=` (a run's children) or `?topLevel=true`.
    - `POST /v1/runs` accepts `options.wait: false`: the binding returns the run id as soon as the run exists and the route answers `202`. The default still answers `201` once the run completes, fails or suspends. `InvokeAgentBindingInput` and `InvokeFlowBindingInput` gain `wait`.
    - `POST /v1/runs/:runId/resume` resumes the run through the host's run handler after completing the waitpoint; the run used to stay suspended. Waitpoint ids starting with `child:` are reserved for the runtime (`400`).
    - New status mappings: `flow-unbound`, `flow-runs-not-supported` and `flow-resume-not-supported` → `422`.
  - `@kindgi/runtime`:
    - `ParentRunRef`, and `parent` on `RunFlowInput` / `StartRunParams`.
    - `RunFlowInput.runId` adopts a `pending` row created by `startRun`.
    - `HandlerResolver` (`handlerResolver` on `RunFlowInput` / `ResumeRunInput`) binds handlers for child flows.
    - `KernelRunRecord.parentRunId` / `parentNodeId` / `parentScope`; `ListRunsInput.parent` and `topLevelOnly`.
    - `KernelRunRecord.output` is documented as the output value itself, not a storage envelope.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `Run.output`, `Run.parentRunId` / `parentNodeId`; `runs.list({ parentRunId, topLevel, includeOutput })`; `StartRunOptions.wait`.
- aec851d: The JSON Schemas now describe what the code accepts (agent 1.1.0, capability 1.1.0, flow 1.9.0, guardrail 1.1.0, pack 1.1.0). The bundled copies in `@kindgi/capabilities`, `@kindgi/flow` and `@kindgi/guardrails` match.
  
  - **BREAKING — `agent.schema.json` 1.1.0:** `tools` entries are `{ id, version }` references (`version` is an npm semver range), matching `ToolRef` and `defineAgent`. Agent JSON with bare-string tool ids — which `defineAgent` already rejected — now fails schema validation too.
  - **BREAKING — `pack.schema.json` 1.1.0:** a pack agent's `tools` use the same `{ id, version }` references (`agent.schema.json#/$defs/ToolRef`). Pack manifests with bare-string tool ids now fail validation.
  - **`capability.schema.json` 1.1.0:** new optional `kind` (default `llm-inference`), which the router already reads, and a `models` requirement (`{ models: { allow?, deny? } }`) next to `providers`. `defineCapability` validates through this schema, so it now accepts both.
  - **BREAKING — `flow.schema.json` 1.9.0:** the top-level `triggers` array is gone. No code read it — schedules, event triggers and webhooks are registered through their own APIs and name the flow they start. Flow JSON that still declares `triggers` now fails `loadFlow`.
  - **BREAKING — `guardrail.schema.json` 1.1.0:** `check` is required, as in the `Guardrail` type (`defineGuardrail` already failed without a registered check), and a `retry` action requires `maxAttempts`. `POST /v1/guardrails` rejects a spec without `check`.
  - **`guardrail.schema.json` 1.1.0 (widening, not breaking):** `kind` and `on-violation` accept any non-empty string — the built-ins are listed as `examples` — so `defineGuardrail`, `validateGuardrailSpec`, the API and the client accept adapter kinds and custom actions. `defineGuardrail` still requires a registered check of the guardrail's kind, and still checks the action's shape. The schema also allows `sandbox`, `limits`, `network` and `needsSpec`, which the type declares, with the same shapes as on tools.
  - **`@kindgi/guardrails`:** when `evaluateGuardrail` runs with `EvaluationBindings.actions` and the fired action has no registered handler, it returns the new `unknown-action` error naming the action (after the violation is recorded) instead of skipping the action silently.
  - **`@kindgi/api` / `@kindgi/client`:** the `Guardrail` wire schema and client types require `check` and `retry.maxAttempts`, and take `kind` / `on-violation` as open strings.
  - **`@kindgi/specs` README:** until the first stable release, a breaking schema change is a minor bump with a version-history note; the major-`$id` rule applies from 1.0.0.
- aec851d: A tenant can hold every agent to its own approval rules: a new policy kind, `hitl`.
  
  - `@kindgi/policy-contract`:
    - **The kind.** `hitl` joins `POLICY_KINDS`. Its spec, `HitlSpec` (`{ maxTimeoutMs?, minReviewerRole?, tools? }`), only tightens an agent's own approval rules: the shorter timeout, the higher reviewer role, and per tool id the stricter gate. `tools` maps a tool id to a mode (`never_ask`, `ask_on_first_use`, `always_ask`) or a rule `{ mode, requiredRole? }`.
    - **Exports.** `HitlSpec`, `ToolHitlMode`, `ToolHitlRule`, `ReviewerRole`, `TOOL_HITL_MODES`, `REVIEWER_ROLES`, `validateHitlSpec`, `combineHitlSpecs` (one spec at least as strict as each), and the helpers `toolHitlRule`, `stricterToolHitlRule`, `higherRole`.
    - **`validatePolicySpec(kind, spec)`** checks a spec against its kind's contract, for `tool-errors` and `hitl`. Other kinds pass.
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Applied per turn.** A turn resolves its approval rules once, at `setup` (and again when it resumes): the agent's `conversationPolicy.hitl`, held to the tenant's `hitl` policy through `policyRegistry`. Each tool call is gated by the stricter of the agent's rule for that tool and the tenant's.
    - **Fails closed.** When the tenant's `hitl` policy can't be evaluated, the turn fails with the new `tenant-policy-unavailable` error (`TenantPolicyUnavailableError`, which carries `policyKind`). Running without the policy would skip the tenant's approvals. No `hitl` executor bound means no tenant policy, as before.
    - **Breaking (preview):** `resolveEffectiveHitlPolicy({ tenant, agent })` takes the tenant's `HitlSpec` or `undefined`. `TenantHitlPolicy` is removed. `EffectiveHitlPolicy` gains `toolFloors`. An agent's tool modes and rules use `@kindgi/policy-contract`'s `ToolHitlMode` and `ToolHitlRule`, unchanged in shape.
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - **Checked when written.** `POST /v1/policies` refuses a `tool-errors` or `hitl` spec that breaks its contract, with `validation-failed`. Each issue is pathed under `spec`, e.g. `spec/tools/acme.pay/mode`. Before, such a spec was stored and only found out on a turn.
    - **Status.** `tenant-policy-unavailable` maps to 503. `PolicyKind` includes `hitl`.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `PolicyKind` includes `hitl`. The Python client's models do too.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the agents skills (TypeScript and Python) say a tenant's `hitl` policy can tighten an agent's gates, never loosen them.
- aec851d: Failed tool calls go back to the model to correct, under a policy.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Retries.** When a tool call fails, the failure goes back to the model as the call's result (what failed, the validation issues, what to do), and the turn continues. A failure the policy doesn't retry, or one past its retries, fails the turn as before.
    - **The setting.** `Agent.toolErrors` (`{ maxRetries?, retryOn? }`) sets how many failed calls go back per turn and for which kinds. Default: one retry, for `invalid-arguments` and `unknown-tool`, where nothing ran. `tool-error` (a tool that ran and failed) is opt-in.
    - **Bounds.** Each retry costs a step against `budget.maxSteps`. Retries are counted from the turn's messages, so a replayed turn counts the same.
    - **Errors.** `tool-invocation-failed` and `unresolved-tool` carry `toolRetries` when retries ran out.
    - **Exports.** `DEFAULT_TOOL_ERRORS` and `effectiveToolErrorPolicy`. A rejected HITL tool approval writes its result through the same path as a retry.
  - `@kindgi/policy-contract`:
    - A new policy kind, `tool-errors`. It caps an agent's setting, like every tenant policy: the fewer retries wins, and only kinds both allow are retried.
    - `ToolErrorsSpec`, `ToolErrorKind`, `TOOL_ERROR_KINDS`, `MAX_TOOL_ERROR_RETRIES` (10), and `validateToolErrorsSpec`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.3.0 adds `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `toolErrors` (`ToolErrorsSpec`). `PolicyKind` derives from `POLICY_KINDS`, so it includes `tool-errors`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `PolicyKind` includes `tool-errors`, and the generated agent types carry `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the agents skill covers `output` and `toolErrors`, and `preferredModel` as `defineAgent` keeps it.
- aec851d: Outbound webhooks: endpoints that receive a signed `run.finished` event when a top-level run completes, fails or is cancelled.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `WebhookEndpointBinding` (caller-plugged) and `/v1/webhook-endpoints`: create (the response carries the signing secret, once), list, get, update, `unregister`, `rotate-secret`, the delivery log (`/deliveries`, with a status filter), `redeliver`, and `test` (queues a `webhook.test` event).
    - Endpoint filter: `projectId`, `flowIds`, `includeDryRuns`. Child runs never produce `run.finished`.
    - Event bodies (`RunFinishedEvent`, `WebhookTestEvent`) carry the run's identity and outcome (`FinishedRun`), never its input or output. The OpenAPI document describes them under `webhooks`.
    - Error codes: `webhook-endpoint-not-found`, `webhook-delivery-not-found` (404), `webhook-url-refused` (400).
  - `@kindgi/crypto`: Standard Webhooks signatures (`v1`, HMAC-SHA256): `signWebhook`, `webhookHeaders`, `verifyWebhook` (timestamp tolerance, several signatures during a secret rotation, constant-time comparison) and `generateWebhookSecret` (`whsec_…`). Checked against the reference implementation both ways.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `client.webhookEndpoints`. The unused outbound shapes `Webhook`, `WebhookSpec`, `WebhookSecret`, `WebhookDelivery`, `WebhookVerifyResult` and the `WebhookId` / `WebhookDeliveryId` brands are replaced by the generated wire types and `WebhookEndpointId`; `SubscriptionSpec`'s webhook target is `{ kind: 'webhook', endpoint }`.
  - `@kindgi/types`: `WebhookEndpointId` and `WebhookEventId`. `WebhookId` is documented as what it is: the routable id of an inbound webhook trigger.
- aec851d: Webhook endpoints reference their signing secret by name instead of generating and returning one.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - Endpoints take `secretRef: { envName, name }`, a secret in the deployment's secrets store (resolved at tenant scope), like a provider's `secret_ref`. The secret is shared with the receiver, so it lives with the deployment's other secrets: `.env` in development, the secrets store in production. Endpoints show `secretRef`; `secretHint` is gone.
    - Create and update check that the secret exists and is strong (`400 webhook-secret-not-found`, `400 webhook-secret-too-weak`). `create` returns the endpoint (no secret).
    - `POST /v1/webhook-endpoints/generate-secret` returns a strong secret to store; nothing is kept.
    - `POST /v1/webhook-endpoints/{endpointId}/rotate-secret` and `WebhookEndpointWithSecret` are removed: rotating is rotating the referenced secret (`POST /v1/secrets/{name}/rotate`), and for a day deliveries are signed with both versions.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `webhookEndpoints.create` takes `secretRef` and returns the endpoint; `webhookEndpoints.generateSecret()`; `rotateSecret` is removed.
  - `@kindgi/crypto`: `isStrongWebhookSecret` and `WEBHOOK_SECRET_MIN_BYTES` (24).

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: What a provider registration can make the server reach, for Gemini and for every provider's region.
  
  - **`metadata.region` must be one DNS label** (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; e.g. `us-central1`, `global`, `unspecified`). Anything else is `400 invalid-provider`, reason `invalid-region`. The Gemini adapter builds its hostname from the region (`https://<region>-aiplatform.googleapis.com/`), so `evil.example/x?` used to move the request to another host. With no `secret_ref`, that request carried the server's own Google credentials.
  - **The Gemini adapter** checks its target itself: the location is one DNS label, and `adapter_config.project` is a Google Cloud project id or number, since it goes into the request path. This holds for `createGeminiProvider` too, not only the factory.
  - **A Gemini `secret_ref` must be a service-account key** (`"type": "service_account"`), reduced to its key fields. Other credential types made the auth library fetch URLs the "key" named, with its headers, or read a file named in it. A key's `token_uri` or `universe_domain` could move the token exchange elsewhere. Google's own token endpoint is always used now.
- aec851d: `KernelError` gains `RunLeaseLostError` (`code: 'run-lease-lost'`): the executor no longer holds the run's lease, because another executor claimed the run after this one's lease expired. It stops without failing or finishing the run, and the lease holder decides what happens to it. `@kindgi/api` maps it to 409, like `run-already-terminal`.
- aec851d: The OpenAPI run status says `pending` where it said `queued`. The server sends `pending` for a run that hasn't started yet, which is what `options.wait: false` answers, and a validating client (the Python client, or one generated with runtime validation) refused that response. A test now holds the document to the runtime's `RunStatus`.
- aec851d: Wire-contract fixes in the API routes and their OpenAPI document.
  
  - **`StartRunBody`**: the agent variant declares the optional `projectId` (UUID) that `POST /v1/runs` already accepts for agent runs. Clients that validate against the schema (it sets `additionalProperties: false`) no longer reject a valid request. Both variants now describe `projectId`: omitted, the run goes to the tenant's Default project.
  - **`PublishAgentBody`, `PublishFlowBody`, `RegisterToolBody`, `RegisterGuardrailBody`, `PublishEvalSuiteBody`, `StartEvalRunBody`**: declare the `projectId` (UUID) their routes already require — `POST /v1/agents`, `/v1/flows`, `/v1/tools`, `/v1/guardrails`, `/v1/eval-suites` and `/v1/eval-suites/:suiteId/runs` answer `400 bad-input` when it is missing or isn't a project of the caller's tenant. It is now listed in `required`, so the documented bodies are the ones the routes accept; before, a schema-validating client rejected every valid request.
  - **`WhoamiResult`**: declares `user` (a `UserRecord`), which `GET /v1/identity/whoami` returns when the deployment wires an identity directory that knows the caller's `userId`.
  - **`GET /v1/audit/authz`**: `?onBehalfOf=`, `?action=` and `?resource=` are now applied in the audit query rather than to the returned page, so a page is full while matching decisions remain and `nextCursor` / `hasMore` are exact. Previously a page could come back short, or empty, with `hasMore: true`. To support this, `AuditEventFilter` (`@kindgi/audit-events`) gains `onBehalfOf` (matches `AuditEvent.onBehalfOf`) and `payloadDoc` (every entry must equal the same field of `payload.doc`); the in-memory binding implements both. A binding that doesn't implement them yet still returns only matching decisions, because the route re-checks the three filters on each page.
  - **`GET /v1/tenant/config`**: now cursor-paginated across the env and secrets bindings. The list is the env entries (in the env binding's order) followed by the secret entries (in the secrets binding's order); a page holds at most `limit` entries, and `nextCursor` / `hasMore` are set when more remain. Previously each binding returned up to `limit` entries (up to twice `limit` in all, sorted by `updatedAt`), `?cursor=` was passed to both bindings unchanged, and `hasMore` was always `false`, so entries past the first page were unreachable. A malformed cursor, or one pointing into a binding the current `?kind=` excludes, returns `400 bad-input`.
  - **`GET /v1/runs/:runId/stream`**: when an event bus is wired but subscribing fails, the stream now falls back to polling the journal as documented. Previously it ended right after the backfill, before the run's later events.
- aec851d: A run blocked by a guardrail now says which one, and clients get it as a typed error.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`: the `guardrail-violation` message (and the `turn.failed` event's) names each blocking guardrail with its check's reason — `Turn blocked by guardrail 'no-pii': Response contains an email` — instead of only counting them.
  - `@kindgi/client` (re-exported by `@kindgi/sdk`): new `GuardrailViolationError` variant of `KindgiError` (`code: 'guardrail-violation'`, `violations[]` with `guardrailId` / `severity` / `action` / `reason?`, `evaluationErrors[]`). `fromWire()` previously returned it as a generic `ServerError`. Exhaustive `switch (err.code)` statements need the new case.
  - `@kindgi/api`: `POST /v1/runs` sends a binding failure's `details` as the wire error's `details`; they were nested under `details.details`, so clients could not read them.
- aec851d: Memory routes reject a scope that names another tenant. `POST /v1/memory/facts`, `POST /v1/memory/retrieve` and `GET /v1/memory/facts?scope=` now answer `400 scope-mismatch` when `scope.tenantId` differs from the caller's tenant (from the token), before the binding is called — the same rule as the secrets, env and policy routes. Previously the write route passed the body's scope through unchecked, so an implementation that writes under `scope.tenantId` could be made to write into another tenant. `MemoryWriteFactInput.tenantId` is documented as the tenant to write under.
- aec851d: OpenAPI descriptions (`openapi.json`, tag and operation text) now describe what each route does and nothing outside the package: corrected status codes and pagination notes (e.g. deployment secret sync answers `404 secret-not-found`; tenant `GET /config` returns a single page; identity-provider registration is not idempotent), no runtime-internal tables, bridges or adapters, and no roadmap notes. Paths, operations, schemas and status codes are unchanged.
- aec851d: Documentation clean-up across the `@kindgi/*` packages: comments, READMEs, OpenAPI descriptions and a few error / "not yet wired" messages no longer point at documents outside this repository or carry internal development-process labels; sample names in examples and tests are neutral (`acme`, `globex`). No behaviour changes.
- aec851d: S3 SigV4 verification now re-derives the signature from exactly what the client signed. Previously header-signed requests only verified when signing and verification fell in the same wall-clock second (the server re-signed with its own clock), and any header added after signing (proxies, the HTTP stack) broke verification; presigned URLs had no expiry check.
  
  - Uses the client's `x-amz-date` / `X-Amz-Date`; rejects requests more than 15 minutes from the server clock (`RequestTimeTooSkewed`).
  - Canonicalizes only the headers listed in `SignedHeaders`; requires `host`, `x-amz-date` and `x-amz-content-sha256` to be signed (header auth).
  - Presigned URLs: enforces `X-Amz-Expires` (`AccessDenied: Request has expired`; at most 7 days, else `AuthorizationQueryParametersError`).
  - `aws4` is no longer a runtime dependency.
- aec851d: Fine-grained authorization now checks the scope a request acts on. Each route derives its scope once, with the same parser for the check and the handler.
  
  - `/v1/env` and `/v1/secrets`: the check reads `scopeKind` + `scopeId`, the parameters the handlers use. It previously read `projectId` / `orgId` query parameters, which are not part of the API, so a request could be checked against one scope and act on another, and project-scoped callers using `scopeId` were checked against the tenant.
  - `POST /v1/secrets/{name}/rotate`: the scope comes from body `scope`, else from the query; when both are present they must name the same scope (400 `scope-mismatch`), and body `envName` must match query `envName` (400 `env-name-mismatch`). The OpenAPI document now declares the optional `envName`, `scopeKind` and `scopeId` query parameters.
  - `POST /v1/mcp/endpoints`: the check reads body `scopeKind` + `scopeId`, as the handler does. `RegisterMCPEndpointBody` now declares them (`scopeKind` required).
  - Registry lists (`/v1/agents`, `/v1/flows`, `/v1/tools`, `/v1/guardrails`, `/v1/eval-suites`): a project filter (`scopeKind=project&scopeId=`) requires `read` on that project.
  - Env and secrets routes run one authorization check per request (previously two).
  
  `@kindgi/client`: `mcp.endpoints.register` takes a required `scope` and sends it as `scopeKind` + `scopeId`; the API has always required them, so registering through the client failed before. `not-yet-wired` reasons for `tools.manifests` and `packs.*` are reworded.
- aec851d: Typed agent output and structured turn input.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Typed output.** An agent can declare `output: { schema, name?, maxRepairs? }` (JSON Schema, or a Zod schema converted by `defineAgent`).
      - The final answer must be JSON matching the schema; a fenced JSON block is accepted.
      - An answer that doesn't fit is sent back to the model with the problems listed, up to `maxRepairs` times (default 1, counted against `budget.maxSteps`). After that the turn fails with `output-schema-violation` (`errors`, `attempts`).
      - The parsed answer is `AgentTurnResult.output`, or `null` on a dry run, where no answer is checked.
    - `AgentTurnResult.runId` is the turn's kernel run.
    - **Structured input.** `invokeAgent({ input })` makes `{{ input.* }}` available to the instructions (`input` joins `AUTO_INJECTED_VARS`). It is kept in the run snapshot and passed to guardrails as `trace.attributes.stepInput`.
    - **Parent link.** `invokeAgent({ parent })` records the run that started the turn, for turns started by a flow step.
    - **Resume.** The run snapshot keeps `parameters` and `input`, and `resumeAgentTurn` restores them; a resumed turn used to lose its parameters. Migration `0002` adds the two columns to `agent_run_snapshots`.
    - **Guardrail trace.** `buildRunTrace` now takes the run id, project id, turn number and user message. The trace carries them, so failed checks during a turn produce compliance evidence. Before, `runId` was the conversation id, `turnCount` was the step count, and `projectId` was missing. `attributes.steps` replaces `attributes.turnCount`; a typed answer appears as `attributes.structuredOutput`.
    - `defineAgent` keeps `preferredModel`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.2.0 adds `output`, `preferredProvider` and `preferredModel`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `output`, `conversationPolicy`, `preferredModel`, `description` and `tags`.
  - `@kindgi/dev-echo-provider`: a call with no tools gets the last user message back as the answer, instead of a call to an echo tool the agent doesn't have.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `output` (`AgentOutputSpec`); `output-schema-violation` maps to 422.
  - `@kindgi/client`: the generated agent types carry `output`.
