# @kindgi/compliance

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- bd3ce67: **Compliance evidence says who acted.** `GET /v1/compliance/evidence` (and `auditEventToEvidence`) now returns each item's `actor` as `{ kind, id }`, read from the audit event it comes from (`user:<id>`, `agent:<id>`, …). Before, the actor was dropped, so evidence of an authorization check or an approval decision didn't say who made it. An actor of a kind evidence can't name (outside `user`, `agent`, `system`, `admin`, `external`) is left out.
- e58e35c: A gated scope always resolves to a pin: publishing a gate policy for a scope that nothing covering it pins is refused (`409 gate-policy-scope-unpinned`, "pin a version for this scope, or one above it, first"), and so is an unpin that would leave a gated scope on the latest version (`409 gate-policy-needs-pin`), where publishing would go live ungated. A gate policy's `spec.comparison.required` is gone: a promotion must name a comparison exactly when the spec has `comparison`, `evidence`, `metrics` or `replay`. A promotion its gate refused is the audit and evidence kind `agent-promotion-refused`.
- 2040daf: Live versions and promotions. An agent version can be made live for a scope: the tenant, an org, a project, or a segment path inside a project (an ordered list of `key:value` steps, coarse to fine, such as company then role). A run that doesn't name its version uses the live version of the most specific scope that has one, else the latest registered version, and records how its version was chosen.
  
  `@kindgi/api` adds `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live` (the version a run would use for a project and segment path, and why), `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live-versions` (every pin), `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions`, `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions[/{promotionId}]` (the history), and `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/live/rollback` and `/live/unpin`. They're mounted when `createApp` gets `agentReleases` (`AgentReleaseBindings`: a `LiveVersionBinding` and a `PromotionBinding`). Promoting, rolling back and unpinning need the new `promote` action on the agent (`@kindgi/authz`). `POST /v1/runs` takes `segments`; a run carries them (`segments`, a child run has its parent's), and a run's `agent` carries `via` (`explicit`, `conversation`, `live` or `latest`) and, for a live version, `liveScope`. `@kindgi/types` adds `LiveScope`, `ScopeSegment` and `AgentVersionVia`; `@kindgi/runtime`'s `RunAgentRef` and `@kindgi/agents`' `InvokeAgentInput` carry `via` and `liveScope`, and `InvokeAgentInput` the turn's `segments`; `RunFlowInput`, `StartRunParams` and `KernelRunRecord` carry the run's `segments`, so a flow's agent steps resolve with them after a resume too. `@kindgi/compliance` and `@kindgi/specs` list the evidence kinds `agent-promotion`, `agent-rollback`, `agent-live-unpinned` and `agent-live-pin-inactive` (a live version that was unregistered: runs use the scope above).
  
  `@kindgi/client` adds `client.agents.live` (`resolve`, `list`, `rollback`, `unpin`), `client.agents.promotions` (`create`, `list`, `get`) and `segments` on `runs.start`; an array query value now repeats its key; `agent-version-not-found` and `promotion-not-found` read as not-found, `nothing-to-roll-back` and `not-pinned` as conflicts, `scope-invalid` as an invalid request. The Python client has the same resources and errors. `@kindgi/cli` adds `kindgi agents live | live-versions | promote | rollback | unpin` and `kindgi agents promotions list | get`, and wires `kindgi agents list | get | versions | unregister`; `kindgi runs start` takes `--project` and `--segment=key:value` (repeated); `get` and `unregister` take the version as an argument (`kindgi agents unregister <agent-id> <version>`). A command's repeatable flag (`--segment=company:acme --segment=role:counsel`) keeps every value.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
