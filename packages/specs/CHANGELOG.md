## 0.1.4-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- 024a47f: **An agent's prompt and settings can come from data blocks, pinned when the agent version is published.**
  
  - **References:**
    - `instructions` is the system prompt, or a prompt block by range: `{ prompt: 'acme.intake-prompt', version: '^1.0.0' }`. Its template and declared parameters are used instead.
    - `settings: [{ id, version }]` lists settings blocks.
    - `modelSettings: { id, version }` names a model-settings block (`MODEL_SETTINGS_SCHEMA`: `temperature`, `maxOutputTokens`).
  - **Pinned at publish:** `POST /v1/agents` and deploys resolve each reference by `pickVersion` into `pins.prompts` / `pins.settings`, alongside the tools.
  - **Refusals:** a reference that matches no published version, names a block of the other kind, names model settings that aren't, or runs on a runtime with no block registry refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`).
  - **At run time:** a turn loads each block at its pinned version. A resumed turn uses the versions its `setup` journaled (`blockVersions`).
    - The prompt block renders as the instructions.
    - Settings values reach tools as `ToolContext.settings['<id>']` and templates as `settings["<id>"]`.
    - Model settings go into the model call.
    - A block that can't load fails the turn (`block-unresolvable`).
    - `InvokeAgentBindings` takes an optional `blockReader`.
  - **Changed elsewhere:** the agent spec, the pack index, both indexers (TS and Python: `Agent(instructions={...}, settings=[...], model_settings={...})`), and both clients.
  - **Pack protocol 2.4.0:** `callContext` gets optional `settings`, so pack code reads them: `ctx.settings['acme.weights']` in TS, `ctx.settings["acme.weights"]` in Python. Older pack services still answer calls that carry it: a TS one passes it to the handler, a Python one drops it.
  - **`settings` is now a reserved template name.**

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- eac7732: A tool knows its run's project and org: `ToolContext.projectId` and `orgId` (Python: `project_id`, `org_id`), and a guardrail check's trace gets `orgId` (`org_id`) next to `projectId`. The runtime sets them from the run and its project, never from the run's input or a model's arguments, so a tool can compare an org or project id in its input with the run's own instead of trusting it. `orgId` is absent when the project has no org. They reach pack code in the call context: pack protocol 2.3.0 adds optional `projectId` and `orgId` to `callContext`. A pack service built with Kindgi 0.1.1 answers such calls as before (it checks only `v`, `tenantId` and `runId`); `@kindgi/pack-conformance` has a suite that proves it against the 0.1.1 releases (`describeCallContextCompatibility`). Also: `NodeContext.projectId` / `orgId` for the kernel, and `InvokeAgentInput.orgId` and `ResumeAgentTurnInput.orgId`, so a turn resumed after an approval keeps its org.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- 89a14b6: Tools from MCP servers built with the TypeScript MCP SDK are no longer skipped. Their schemas declare JSON Schema draft-07 (`"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"`), and every tool schema compiled as Draft 2020-12 only, so each one failed with `no schema with key or ref "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"`. An MCP tool's schemas (`transport: 'mcp'`) now compile in the dialect they declare: draft-06, draft-07, 2019-09 or 2020-12 (the default when they declare none), each with its own semantics (a draft-07 array-form `items` is a tuple), and without Ajv's strict mode, a lint for the schemas a pack writes: a server's union `type`s, open tuples and extension keywords are valid JSON Schema. Another dialect is refused, naming it. A pack's own tools are unchanged: Draft 2020-12, in strict mode; one declaring another dialect is refused with a message that says so. `@kindgi/schema` exports the compiler as `compileJsonSchema` (with `dialects` and `strict` options), and `jsonSchemaDialect`. `tool.schema.json`'s `input` and `output` descriptions say which dialects a tool's schemas may be in.

## 0.1.1

No changes in this release.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: The indexer carries a tool's `mutating` into `index.json`. It dropped it, so in `kindgi dev` (and anything built from the index) every pack tool counted as mutating: a dry run never ran a pack tool, and an agent's opt-in per-tool approval gates asked even before read-only ones. `pack-index.schema.json` 1.3.0 adds the optional `mutating`; the Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
- aec851d: A pack declares the process environment its code reads, and the pack service says what's missing.
  
  - **`kindgi.config`** takes `env: { required?, optional? }`: the names the pack's code reads from `process.env`. The indexer validates them (environment variable names, no `KINDGI_*`, no name twice) and writes them, sorted, into `index.json` as `env`, which is absent when nothing is declared. A malformed declaration fails indexing as `config-invalid`. `resolvePackEnv` and `missingPackEnv` are exported for tools that check the same thing.
  - **The pack service**, with a required name unset or empty, isn't ready: `/readyz` and every call answer 503 `{ "error": "missing env", "missingEnv": [...] }`, names only. `/v1/info` always lists `missingEnv`, and the names are logged once at startup (`missing-env`). `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_CHECK=warn` serves anyway; anything other than `strict` (the default) or `warn` fails startup.
  - **`@kindgi/specs`:** `pack-index.schema.json` 1.4.0 adds the optional `env`; `pack-protocol.schema.json` 2.2.0 adds the optional `missingEnv` to `info`. The Python SDK's vendored copies match.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_CHECK` (component `pack-service`).
  - **`@kindgi/pack-conformance`:** cases for the declared env, and `unsupported` on a target, which skips the cases for a part of the contract it hasn't implemented yet.
  - **The `kindgi-authoring-tools` skill** says to declare the names a tool reads.
- aec851d: Tool secrets reach the tools that declare them.
  
  - `@kindgi/env-schema`: `KINDGI_ENV`, the env a runtime serves. Secrets a tool declares by name (`needsSpec.secrets`) resolve under it; development mode defaults it to `local`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries a declarative tool's `spec` (`defineTool({ spec })`) into `index.json`, so the runtime runs the tool itself and resolves its `secretRef`s, instead of the pack service running it without them.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `pack-index.schema.json` 1.2.0 adds a tool's optional `spec`. The Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the `kindgi-python-authoring-tools` skill — and the Python SDK's README and `ToolContext.secrets` docstring — say how to declare a secret (`needs_spec={"secrets": …}`) and read it from `ctx.secrets`; `ctx.env` and `ctx.config` are still empty.
- aec851d: A guardrail's `config` reaches the dev index, and the pack service compiles each tool's schemas once.
  
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`:
    - **Fix: guardrail `config` in the index.** The indexer now writes a guardrail's `config` (what its check is configured with) to the index. In `kindgi dev`, a configured guardrail ran without its config.
    - **Validators are compiled once.** The pack service compiles a tool's input and output validators once and reuses them, instead of compiling them on every call: about 12 ms off each tool call. An edited schema compiles again, so hot reload still takes effect.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `pack-index.schema.json` 1.1.0 adds a guardrail's `config`. The Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
- aec851d: Flows can say what each step receives and what the run returns (flow schema-version 1.8.0), and a conditional branch that rejoins no longer stalls.
  
  - `@kindgi/flow`:
    - New optional `inputMapping` on tool / agent nodes: each key resolves from `runInput`, `state` or `nodeOutputs.<nodeId>` when the node dispatches, so a step can combine the run input and the outputs of any earlier steps. Without it, a node still receives its single upstream node's output.
    - New optional flow-level `output: { mapping, schema? }` declaring the run's output.
    - `maxParallelism` is now accepted by the schema; it was in the TypeScript type only, so `loadFlow` rejected it.
    - `resolveMapping(mapping, env)` resolves a `Mapping`; a path that does not resolve omits its key.
    - The loader rejects mappings that name no node, map a node's own output, or use a loop-only root, with the new `invalid-mapping` error. An output schema that does not compile is the new `invalid-flow-output` error.
    - Scheduler: a node whose every incoming edge is not taken, or comes from such a skipped node, is skipped. A join after an `if` branch used to wait for the skipped arm forever, so the run ended as stuck.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `flow.schema.json` 1.8.0 (the `Mapping` and `FlowOutput` definitions; `inputMapping` on leaf nodes; `output` and `maxParallelism` at the root).
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer validates each discovered flow with `loadFlow`, reporting the loader's message as a file error, and keeps `description`, `maxParallelism`, `metadata` and `output` in `index.json`.
- aec851d: The pack contracts are specs: `pack-index.schema.json` (the `index.json` a pack build emits) and `pack-protocol.schema.json` (pack protocol v2 — the messages, routes, headers and process contract of a pack service). `@kindgi/pack-conformance` checks any language's indexer and pack service against them, black-box, over one fixture pack; the Node pack service and the Python `kindgi` package both pass it.
- aec851d: A pack's code no longer sees the pack service's token.
  
  - **Fix (`@kindgi/handler-runtime`, and the Python SDK's `kindgi.pack.serve`):** the pack service reads `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_TOKEN`, then removes it from its process environment before it loads the pack's code. Before, a tool, or any dependency it imported, could read the token. Whoever holds the token can call the pack's tools directly, without going through the runtime.
  - **`@kindgi/specs`:** `pack-protocol.schema.json` 2.1.0 adds this to the process contract, which every pack service follows. The Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
  - **`@kindgi/pack-conformance`:** a new fixture tool, `conformance.process-env`, returns the `KINDGI_` variables its process can see. The new case "pack code doesn't see the service token" checks it, in every implementation.
- aec851d: The JSON Schemas now describe what the code accepts (agent 1.1.0, capability 1.1.0, flow 1.9.0, guardrail 1.1.0, pack 1.1.0). The bundled copies in `@kindgi/capabilities`, `@kindgi/flow` and `@kindgi/guardrails` match.
  
  - **BREAKING — `agent.schema.json` 1.1.0:** `tools` entries are `{ id, version }` references (`version` is an npm semver range), matching `ToolRef` and `defineAgent`. Agent JSON with bare-string tool ids — which `defineAgent` already rejected — now fails schema validation too.
  - **BREAKING — `pack.schema.json` 1.1.0:** a pack agent's `tools` use the same `{ id, version }` references (`agent.schema.json#/$defs/ToolRef`). Pack manifests with bare-string tool ids now fail validation.
  - **`capability.schema.json` 1.1.0:** new optional `kind` (default `llm-inference`), which the router already reads, and a `models` requirement (`{ models: { allow?, deny? } }`) next to `providers`. `defineCapability` validates through this schema, so it now accepts both.
  - **BREAKING — `flow.schema.json` 1.9.0:** the top-level `triggers` array is gone. No code read it — schedules, event triggers and webhooks are registered through their own APIs and name the flow they start. Flow JSON that still declares `triggers` now fails `loadFlow`.
  - **BREAKING — `guardrail.schema.json` 1.1.0:** `check` is required, as in the `Guardrail` type (`defineGuardrail` already failed without a registered check), and a `retry` action requires `maxAttempts`. `POST /v1/guardrails` rejects a spec without `check`.
  - **`guardrail.schema.json` 1.1.0 (widening, not breaking):** `kind` and `on-violation` accept any non-empty string — the built-ins are listed as `examples` — so `defineGuardrail`, `validateGuardrailSpec`, the API and the client accept adapter kinds and custom actions. `defineGuardrail` still requires a registered check of the guardrail's kind, and still checks the action's shape. The schema also allows `sandbox`, `limits`, `network` and `needsSpec`, which the type declares, with the same shapes as on tools.
  - **`@kindgi/guardrails`:** when `evaluateGuardrail` runs with `EvaluationBindings.actions` and the fired action has no registered handler, it returns the new `unknown-action` error naming the action (after the violation is recorded) instead of skipping the action silently.
  - **`@kindgi/api` / `@kindgi/client`:** the `Guardrail` wire schema and client types require `check` and `retry.maxAttempts`, and take `kind` / `on-violation` as open strings.
  - **`@kindgi/specs` README:** until the first stable release, a breaking schema change is a minor bump with a version-history note; the major-`$id` rule applies from 1.0.0.
- aec851d: Failed tool calls go back to the model to correct, under a policy.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Retries.** When a tool call fails, the failure goes back to the model as the call's result (what failed, the validation issues, what to do), and the turn continues. A failure the policy doesn't retry, or one past its retries, fails the turn as before.
    - **The setting.** `Agent.toolErrors` (`{ maxRetries?, retryOn? }`) sets how many failed calls go back per turn and for which kinds. Default: one retry, for `invalid-arguments` and `unknown-tool`, where nothing ran. `tool-error` (a tool that ran and failed) is opt-in.
    - **Bounds.** Each retry costs a step against `budget.maxSteps`. Retries are counted from the turn's messages, so a replayed turn counts the same.
    - **Errors.** `tool-invocation-failed` and `unresolved-tool` carry `toolRetries` when retries ran out.
    - **Exports.** `DEFAULT_TOOL_ERRORS` and `effectiveToolErrorPolicy`. A rejected HITL tool approval writes its result through the same path as a retry.
  - `@kindgi/policy-contract`:
    - A new policy kind, `tool-errors`. It caps an agent's setting, like every tenant policy: the fewer retries wins, and only kinds both allow are retried.
    - `ToolErrorsSpec`, `ToolErrorKind`, `TOOL_ERROR_KINDS`, `MAX_TOOL_ERROR_RETRIES` (10), and `validateToolErrorsSpec`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.3.0 adds `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `toolErrors` (`ToolErrorsSpec`). `PolicyKind` derives from `POLICY_KINDS`, so it includes `tool-errors`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `PolicyKind` includes `tool-errors`, and the generated agent types carry `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the agents skill covers `output` and `toolErrors`, and `preferredModel` as `defineAgent` keeps it.
- aec851d: Typed agent output and structured turn input.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Typed output.** An agent can declare `output: { schema, name?, maxRepairs? }` (JSON Schema, or a Zod schema converted by `defineAgent`).
      - The final answer must be JSON matching the schema; a fenced JSON block is accepted.
      - An answer that doesn't fit is sent back to the model with the problems listed, up to `maxRepairs` times (default 1, counted against `budget.maxSteps`). After that the turn fails with `output-schema-violation` (`errors`, `attempts`).
      - The parsed answer is `AgentTurnResult.output`, or `null` on a dry run, where no answer is checked.
    - `AgentTurnResult.runId` is the turn's kernel run.
    - **Structured input.** `invokeAgent({ input })` makes `{{ input.* }}` available to the instructions (`input` joins `AUTO_INJECTED_VARS`). It is kept in the run snapshot and passed to guardrails as `trace.attributes.stepInput`.
    - **Parent link.** `invokeAgent({ parent })` records the run that started the turn, for turns started by a flow step.
    - **Resume.** The run snapshot keeps `parameters` and `input`, and `resumeAgentTurn` restores them; a resumed turn used to lose its parameters. Migration `0002` adds the two columns to `agent_run_snapshots`.
    - **Guardrail trace.** `buildRunTrace` now takes the run id, project id, turn number and user message. The trace carries them, so failed checks during a turn produce compliance evidence. Before, `runId` was the conversation id, `turnCount` was the step count, and `projectId` was missing. `attributes.steps` replaces `attributes.turnCount`; a typed answer appears as `attributes.structuredOutput`.
    - `defineAgent` keeps `preferredModel`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.2.0 adds `output`, `preferredProvider` and `preferredModel`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `output`, `conversationPolicy`, `preferredModel`, `description` and `tags`.
  - `@kindgi/dev-echo-provider`: a call with no tools gets the last user message back as the answer, instead of a call to an echo tool the agent doesn't have.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `output` (`AgentOutputSpec`); `output-schema-violation` maps to 422.
  - `@kindgi/client`: the generated agent types carry `output`.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: JSON Schema descriptions (51, across 12 schemas and their bundled copies) now match the code and stay inside this repository: neutral examples (`acme.*`), no vendor names the code doesn't target, "the Kindgi runtime" instead of "the OS", no roadmap notes, and corrected claims (tool `needs` are declarative, `capability-unsatisfiable` happens at routing time, `step.cancelled` wording, SSE `eventId`). `Capability.budget` and `Guardrail.budget` are documented as declarative — not enforced by the runtime — in the schemas and the TypeScript types. Only `description` values changed; keys, types, enums and `$comment` schema versions are unchanged.
