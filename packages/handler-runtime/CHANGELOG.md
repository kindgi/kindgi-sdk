# @kindgi/handler-runtime

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: Build extensions for a TypeScript pack image: `image` in `kindgi.config.*`, with `@kindgi/sdk/build`.
  
  ```ts
  import { prisma } from '@kindgi/sdk/build';
  
  export default {
    pack: { id: 'acme.app', version: '1.0.0' },
    image: {
      systemPackages: ['tesseract-ocr'],
      extensions: [prisma({ schema: 'prisma/schema.prisma', config: 'prisma.config.ts' })],
      buildEnv: { DATABASE_URL: 'postgresql://build-placeholder' },
    },
  };
  ```
  
  - **`@kindgi/handler-runtime/build-extensions`**, re-exported as **`@kindgi/sdk/build`**:
    - `ImageConfig` and `BuildExtension` (`contextFiles`, `systemPackages`, `postInstall` steps, `buildEnv`);
    - `prisma({ schema, config? })`: copies the schema in and runs `prisma generate` after the install, before the prune. An app's `postinstall` doesn't run in the image;
    - `defineBuildExtension()`.
  - **`kindgi build`** reads and checks `image`, naming any field that's wrong, then renders it:
    - system packages in the base stage;
    - `buildEnv` in the install stage only, never the final image;
    - each step after the install, through the app's package manager (`pnpm exec`, `npx --no`, `yarn`).
- aec851d: A pack declares the process environment its code reads, and the pack service says what's missing.
  
  - **`kindgi.config`** takes `env: { required?, optional? }`: the names the pack's code reads from `process.env`. The indexer validates them (environment variable names, no `KINDGI_*`, no name twice) and writes them, sorted, into `index.json` as `env`, which is absent when nothing is declared. A malformed declaration fails indexing as `config-invalid`. `resolvePackEnv` and `missingPackEnv` are exported for tools that check the same thing.
  - **The pack service**, with a required name unset or empty, isn't ready: `/readyz` and every call answer 503 `{ "error": "missing env", "missingEnv": [...] }`, names only. `/v1/info` always lists `missingEnv`, and the names are logged once at startup (`missing-env`). `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_CHECK=warn` serves anyway; anything other than `strict` (the default) or `warn` fails startup.
  - **`@kindgi/specs`:** `pack-index.schema.json` 1.4.0 adds the optional `env`; `pack-protocol.schema.json` 2.2.0 adds the optional `missingEnv` to `info`. The Python SDK's vendored copies match.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_CHECK` (component `pack-service`).
  - **`@kindgi/pack-conformance`:** cases for the declared env, and `unsupported` on a target, which skips the cases for a part of the contract it hasn't implemented yet.
  - **The `kindgi-authoring-tools` skill** says to declare the names a tool reads.
- aec851d: A TypeScript pack image that works: it runs the pack's bundles, installs the app the way the app does, and `kindgi build --local` builds it with this machine's Docker.
  
  `@kindgi/handler-runtime`:
  - `runIndexer({ bundleMap, moduleRoot })` indexes a build. The map's source paths are the file list, classified by the discovery patterns, so the source tree needn't be there. Each file is imported from its bundle, and the index records the source path. `kindgi-index` takes `--bundle-map` and `--module-root`.
  - `kindgi-index-main`: the indexer as a process entry. Before, the image's indexer stage loaded `kindgi-index` and exited without writing an index.
  - The pack service's `--bundle-map`: the modules the index names load from their bundles.
  
  `@kindgi/cli`, `kindgi build`:
  - **Bundles:**
    - the pack's code is bundled, and its installed dependencies stay external, imported by name from the image's `node_modules`;
    - the indexer and the pack service are self-contained bundles;
    - every bundle is `.mjs` with sourcemaps, plus `dist/bundle-map.json` and the bundled `kindgi.config`;
    - the local index runs the same bundled indexer over the same bundles as the image, so the integrity gate compares like with like.
  - **Install:** the app's own package manager from its own lockfile, frozen with scripts off, then the build scripts the app allows, then a prune to production. pnpm and yarn come through corepack and the `packageManager` field. A pack in a workspace member sits at its own path.
    - `.npmrc` and `.yarnrc*` are build secrets, never in the context.
    - A dependency linked from outside the project is refused, with what to do instead.
    - The synthesized `package.json` is gone.
  - **Base image:** `node:22` or `node:24-bookworm-slim`, pinned by image index digest, picked from `engines.node` (`scripts/refresh-node-digests.mjs`).
  - **The Containerfile:** tini, `USER node`, `HEALTHCHECK`, `EXPOSE 8080`, `NODE_ENV=production`.
  - **The context:** the install's files, the bundles and `bundle.include`. The pack's source never ships.
  - **`--local`:** `docker buildx build --load` into the local image store as `kindgi-pack/<packId>:<artifactVersion>`, with the same integrity gate. No build service, no signing.
- aec851d: The pack service is the only way pack code runs. The old run-queue controller and the stdio worker are removed.
  
  - **Breaking (preview), `@kindgi/handler-runtime`:**
    - **Removed:**
      - the run-queue controller (`managed-run-controller`) and its run fetchers (`HttpFetcher`, `InMemoryFetcher`);
      - the per-call sandbox invokers (`tool-sandbox-invoker`, `check-sandbox-invoker`);
      - the version-1 stdio worker protocol: its frames, `encodeFrame`, `parseStdinFrame(s)`, `runWorkerStdio`, the worker's `main` and `PROTOCOL_VERSION`.
  
      None of these had a caller. A pack image now runs the pack service, which replaced them.
    - **Removed exports:** `./managed-run-controller`, `./managed-run-worker`, `./fetchers/http`, `./fetchers/in-memory`, `./tool-sandbox-invoker` and `./check-sandbox-invoker`, and their names on the package root.
    - **The handler runner:**
      - `runWorker` is now `runHandler` (`RunHandlerOptions`), and the check runner is `runCheck` (`RunCheckOptions`), both exported from the package root. They're unchanged apart from the names.
      - `HandlerErrorCode` drops the four stdio-only codes (`malformed-stdin-frame`, `unknown-envelope-version`, `unexpected-frame-kind`, `stdin-closed`).
  - **Fix: a guardrail check in the pack service gets the call's abort signal.** `runCheck` takes `abortSignal` and passes it as `bindings.abortSignal`, and the pack service passes its call's signal, which fires on the deadline or when the caller disconnects. Before, a check got empty bindings and kept running after its call ended.
  - `@kindgi/agents`, `@kindgi/sdk`: comments and a skill's sources name the handler runner.
- aec851d: `createPackServiceSupervisor` takes an optional `token`: the one its front's callers send. Default: a new random one per supervisor, as before. Pass the previous supervisor's token, with its `port`, so a caller started with both keeps reaching the front across restarts. That caller is a runtime running from source for `kindgi dev --runtime-url`. A given token is at least 32 URL-safe base64 characters.
- aec851d: Tool secrets reach the tools that declare them.
  
  - `@kindgi/env-schema`: `KINDGI_ENV`, the env a runtime serves. Secrets a tool declares by name (`needsSpec.secrets`) resolve under it; development mode defaults it to `local`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries a declarative tool's `spec` (`defineTool({ spec })`) into `index.json`, so the runtime runs the tool itself and resolves its `secretRef`s, instead of the pack service running it without them.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `pack-index.schema.json` 1.2.0 adds a tool's optional `spec`. The Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the `kindgi-python-authoring-tools` skill — and the Python SDK's README and `ToolContext.secrets` docstring — say how to declare a secret (`needs_spec={"secrets": …}`) and read it from `ctx.secrets`; `ctx.env` and `ctx.config` are still empty.
- aec851d: Flows can say what each step receives and what the run returns (flow schema-version 1.8.0), and a conditional branch that rejoins no longer stalls.
  
  - `@kindgi/flow`:
    - New optional `inputMapping` on tool / agent nodes: each key resolves from `runInput`, `state` or `nodeOutputs.<nodeId>` when the node dispatches, so a step can combine the run input and the outputs of any earlier steps. Without it, a node still receives its single upstream node's output.
    - New optional flow-level `output: { mapping, schema? }` declaring the run's output.
    - `maxParallelism` is now accepted by the schema; it was in the TypeScript type only, so `loadFlow` rejected it.
    - `resolveMapping(mapping, env)` resolves a `Mapping`; a path that does not resolve omits its key.
    - The loader rejects mappings that name no node, map a node's own output, or use a loop-only root, with the new `invalid-mapping` error. An output schema that does not compile is the new `invalid-flow-output` error.
    - Scheduler: a node whose every incoming edge is not taken, or comes from such a skipped node, is skipped. A join after an `if` branch used to wait for the skipped arm forever, so the run ended as stuck.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `flow.schema.json` 1.8.0 (the `Mapping` and `FlowOutput` definitions; `inputMapping` on leaf nodes; `output` and `maxParallelism` at the root).
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer validates each discovered flow with `loadFlow`, reporting the loader's message as a file error, and keeps `description`, `maxParallelism`, `metadata` and `output` in `index.json`.
- aec851d: Pack code in any language.
  
  - `createPackServiceSupervisor` takes `command` — the child's argv — instead of `entrypoint`, `nodeBinary` and `nodeArgs`: `[process.execPath, <pack-service-main>]` for this package's service, `[python, '-m', 'kindgi.pack', 'serve']` for the Python SDK's.
  - A pack's config may be the `[tool.kindgi]` table of its `pyproject.toml` (same keys as `kindgi.config.*`): a Python pack. `KindgiConfig.language` (`'node' | 'python'`), `packLanguage`, `findKindgiConfig`, `PYPROJECT_FILENAME`, `DEFAULT_PYTHON_DISCOVERY`; `resolveDiscovery` takes the language. `runIndexer` refuses a Python pack with `language-mismatch`.
- aec851d: `createPackServiceSupervisor` runs the pack service as a local child process behind a stable front: one loopback address and session token for the supervisor's life, forwarding to whichever child serves (code swaps on `start`, the previous child drains, a failed boot keeps the old one, a crashed child restarts). Forwarding is a separate `relay` (request body plus deadline, run and request ids, protocol version, and a cancel signal), reusable by other listeners. A retiring child gets its full drain (`PACK_SERVICE_DRAIN_MS`, 8 s) plus 2 s before it is killed, so a call it would still finish is never cut off.
  
  `pack-service-main` takes `--host <address>` (default: every interface). Stopping the pack service now also closes connections left by callers that went away mid-call, which used to hold shutdown for several seconds.
- aec851d: A pack service to run a pack's code over HTTP (pack protocol v2), and tools learn which run they belong to.
  
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`:
    - New `./protocol` (v2): tool and check requests name the tool or check by id, and responses are `result`, `check-result` or `error` messages with typed codes (including `tool-not-in-pack`, `tool-version-mismatch`, `deadline-exceeded` and `cancelled`).
    - New `./pack-service`: `createPackService` and `startPackService` expose `POST /v1/invoke`, `GET /v1/info`, `/healthz` and `/readyz`, with token auth, a concurrency cap, a body limit, deadlines, cancellation on disconnect, prewarm and drain.
    - New `./pack-service-main`: the process entry (`KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `KINDGI_PACK_INDEX`, `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, `PORT`; SIGTERM drains).
    - `HandlerContext.abortSignal` (in-process calls only) lets handlers stop on cancel or deadline.
    - The v1 worker, controller and invokers are unchanged.
  - `@kindgi/tools`: `ToolContext.runId`, the kernel run a call belongs to. `requestId` stays the individual call's id.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: agent tool calls set `runId` to the turn's kernel run. They used to pass only the model's call id.
- aec851d: Kindgi inside an existing app: project-local configuration, the app's own env files, nothing leaks.
  
  - **BREAKING — `@kindgi/env-schema`:** the runtime reads only `KINDGI_*` names. `DATABASE_URL` → `KINDGI_DATABASE_URL`, `OPENFGA_API_URL` → `KINDGI_OPENFGA_API_URL`, with no fallback; every unprefixed name belongs to the agents.
  - **`@kindgi/dotenv-file`:** parses the dotenv format the way applications do (verified against `dotenv@16.3.1`), adds `${VAR}` expansion (agrees with dotenv-expand 10 and 12 where they agree) and layered reading. The writer keeps hand-written lines byte for byte and refuses values it can't write back unchanged.
  - **`@kindgi/handler-runtime`:** `loadKindgiConfig` — one loader for `kindgi.config.*` (including `.mts` for CommonJS hosts) that reports a broken config's cause; `resolveDiscovery` walks only each discovery pattern's fixed prefix instead of the whole host repo.
  - **`@kindgi/secrets-dotenv`:** one resolver for a pack's env files (`.env` < `.env.local`, or `dev.envFiles`). `KINDGI_*` names never resolve as secrets, dev writes go only to `.env.local`, and warnings name `file:line`, never the line itself.
  - **`@kindgi/sdk`:** authoring skills updated (a handler with nothing to `await` can return `Promise.resolve`).

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: The indexer carries a tool's `mutating` into `index.json`. It dropped it, so in `kindgi dev` (and anything built from the index) every pack tool counted as mutating: a dry run never ran a pack tool, and an agent's opt-in per-tool approval gates asked even before read-only ones. `pack-index.schema.json` 1.3.0 adds the optional `mutating`; the Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
- aec851d: A guardrail's `config` reaches the dev index, and the pack service compiles each tool's schemas once.
  
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`:
    - **Fix: guardrail `config` in the index.** The indexer now writes a guardrail's `config` (what its check is configured with) to the index. In `kindgi dev`, a configured guardrail ran without its config.
    - **Validators are compiled once.** The pack service compiles a tool's input and output validators once and reuses them, instead of compiling them on every call: about 12 ms off each tool call. An edited schema compiles again, so hot reload still takes effect.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `pack-index.schema.json` 1.1.0 adds a guardrail's `config`. The Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
- aec851d: `pack-service-main` and `managed-run-worker` run when started through a symlinked path (`node node_modules/@kindgi/handler-runtime/dist/pack-service/main.js` in a pnpm install). They compared `import.meta.url` with `process.argv[1]` as given, so through a symlink they exited 0 without serving.
- aec851d: A pack's code no longer sees the pack service's token.
  
  - **Fix (`@kindgi/handler-runtime`, and the Python SDK's `kindgi.pack.serve`):** the pack service reads `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_TOKEN`, then removes it from its process environment before it loads the pack's code. Before, a tool, or any dependency it imported, could read the token. Whoever holds the token can call the pack's tools directly, without going through the runtime.
  - **`@kindgi/specs`:** `pack-protocol.schema.json` 2.1.0 adds this to the process contract, which every pack service follows. The Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
  - **`@kindgi/pack-conformance`:** a new fixture tool, `conformance.process-env`, returns the `KINDGI_` variables its process can see. The new case "pack code doesn't see the service token" checks it, in every implementation.
- aec851d: Failed tool calls go back to the model to correct, under a policy.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Retries.** When a tool call fails, the failure goes back to the model as the call's result (what failed, the validation issues, what to do), and the turn continues. A failure the policy doesn't retry, or one past its retries, fails the turn as before.
    - **The setting.** `Agent.toolErrors` (`{ maxRetries?, retryOn? }`) sets how many failed calls go back per turn and for which kinds. Default: one retry, for `invalid-arguments` and `unknown-tool`, where nothing ran. `tool-error` (a tool that ran and failed) is opt-in.
    - **Bounds.** Each retry costs a step against `budget.maxSteps`. Retries are counted from the turn's messages, so a replayed turn counts the same.
    - **Errors.** `tool-invocation-failed` and `unresolved-tool` carry `toolRetries` when retries ran out.
    - **Exports.** `DEFAULT_TOOL_ERRORS` and `effectiveToolErrorPolicy`. A rejected HITL tool approval writes its result through the same path as a retry.
  - `@kindgi/policy-contract`:
    - A new policy kind, `tool-errors`. It caps an agent's setting, like every tenant policy: the fewer retries wins, and only kinds both allow are retried.
    - `ToolErrorsSpec`, `ToolErrorKind`, `TOOL_ERROR_KINDS`, `MAX_TOOL_ERROR_RETRIES` (10), and `validateToolErrorsSpec`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.3.0 adds `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `toolErrors` (`ToolErrorsSpec`). `PolicyKind` derives from `POLICY_KINDS`, so it includes `tool-errors`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `PolicyKind` includes `tool-errors`, and the generated agent types carry `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the agents skill covers `output` and `toolErrors`, and `preferredModel` as `defineAgent` keeps it.
- aec851d: Typed agent output and structured turn input.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Typed output.** An agent can declare `output: { schema, name?, maxRepairs? }` (JSON Schema, or a Zod schema converted by `defineAgent`).
      - The final answer must be JSON matching the schema; a fenced JSON block is accepted.
      - An answer that doesn't fit is sent back to the model with the problems listed, up to `maxRepairs` times (default 1, counted against `budget.maxSteps`). After that the turn fails with `output-schema-violation` (`errors`, `attempts`).
      - The parsed answer is `AgentTurnResult.output`, or `null` on a dry run, where no answer is checked.
    - `AgentTurnResult.runId` is the turn's kernel run.
    - **Structured input.** `invokeAgent({ input })` makes `{{ input.* }}` available to the instructions (`input` joins `AUTO_INJECTED_VARS`). It is kept in the run snapshot and passed to guardrails as `trace.attributes.stepInput`.
    - **Parent link.** `invokeAgent({ parent })` records the run that started the turn, for turns started by a flow step.
    - **Resume.** The run snapshot keeps `parameters` and `input`, and `resumeAgentTurn` restores them; a resumed turn used to lose its parameters. Migration `0002` adds the two columns to `agent_run_snapshots`.
    - **Guardrail trace.** `buildRunTrace` now takes the run id, project id, turn number and user message. The trace carries them, so failed checks during a turn produce compliance evidence. Before, `runId` was the conversation id, `turnCount` was the step count, and `projectId` was missing. `attributes.steps` replaces `attributes.turnCount`; a typed answer appears as `attributes.structuredOutput`.
    - `defineAgent` keeps `preferredModel`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.2.0 adds `output`, `preferredProvider` and `preferredModel`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `output`, `conversationPolicy`, `preferredModel`, `description` and `tags`.
  - `@kindgi/dev-echo-provider`: a call with no tools gets the last user message back as the answer, instead of a call to an echo tool the agent doesn't have.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `output` (`AgentOutputSpec`); `output-schema-violation` maps to 422.
  - `@kindgi/client`: the generated agent types carry `output`.
- aec851d: Tool inputs get their Zod defaults, transforms and refinements.
  
  - `@kindgi/schema`:
    - `toJSONSchema(schema, io)` and `toJSONSchemaSync(schema, converter, io)` take a required `io` (`SchemaIo`, `'input'` or `'output'`). The two sides differ exactly where Zod defaults: on the input side a `.default()` field is optional, on the output side it is required. Before, every conversion produced the output side.
    - `parseWithSchema(schema, value)` parses through a Zod schema's Standard Schema interface: defaults, transforms and refinements applied, or the issues.
  - `@kindgi/tools`:
    - A tool's advertised input schema is the input side, so a model may leave a defaulted field out.
    - `invokeTool` validates a copy of the input, filling in JSON Schema `default`s. A Zod-authored tool's input is then parsed with `inputZod`, so the handler gets its parsed input. A failed refinement is `input-validation-failed`, with the field's path.
    - A handler's input type defaults to `InferOutput` of the input schema, the parsed type.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: `runWorker`, which the pack service runs tools through, prepares the input the same way. The indexer converts tool inputs and guardrail config on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: a check's config schema converts on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: a typed agent's output schema converts on the output side, so downstream steps can rely on every field.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the tools skill explains what a handler receives.
