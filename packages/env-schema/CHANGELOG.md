### Patch Changes

- fdb86ae: Reviewers can be told when an approval waits for them.
  
  - **`approval.requested` webhook event:** an endpoint can subscribe to it like `run.finished`.
    - **When:** sent each time an approval starts waiting (an escalation opens a new one).
    - **What:** `data.approval` carries `approvalId`, `projectId`, `requiredRole`, `title`, `assignedTo`, `createdAt`, `expiresAt` and `url`. Never what the approval is about: no `context`, tool call or run input.
    - **Filter:** the endpoint's `projectId` narrows it to the approval's project.
  - **`KINDGI_REVIEWER_EMAIL`** (off by default): `on` emails reviewers through the emailed sign-in link's server.
    - **Who:** the people the approvals list would show the approval to, only those who may read its project.
    - **How often:** the first email goes at once, then a five-minute digest.
    - **What:** title, project, required role and a link only.
    - **Without the server:** turned on without `KINDGI_AUTH_EMAIL_SMTP_URL` and `KINDGI_AUTH_EMAIL_FROM`, the runtime refuses to start.
  - **Clients:** the TypeScript and Python clients type the new event. The Python client's `parse_event` reads it.
- 8b9e90d: Azure settings for the runtime: `KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND_KMS=azure` with `KINDGI_SECRETS_AZURE_KEY_ID` (an Azure Key Vault key wraps the postgres backend's DEKs), `KINDGI_IMAGE_REGISTRY_AUTH=azure` (Azure Container Registry with the server's managed identity), and `KINDGI_AZURE_CLIENT_ID` (which user-assigned identity the server uses). `parseAzureKeyId` checks the key's URL and refuses one pinned to a version. `kindgi env init --kms=azure` writes them.
- 796c790: `KINDGI_SECRETS_AWS_REGION`, `KINDGI_SECRETS_AWS_KMS_KEY_ID` and `KINDGI_SECRETS_MANAGER=aws` say they're used from runtime 0.1.7: runtime 0.1.6 refuses `KINDGI_SECRETS_MANAGER=aws` at startup.
- 36c31ea: **The server's AWS identity, in the env schema** (group `aws`):
  - `KINDGI_AWS_IDENTITY`: `container`, `instance`, `web-identity` or `profile` (development only);
  - `KINDGI_AWS_PROFILE`;
  - `KINDGI_AWS_ROLE_ARN`, a role to assume, with `KINDGI_AWS_ROLE_SESSION_NAME` and `KINDGI_AWS_STS_REGION`.
  
  The runtime reads them from 0.1.7 on (0.1.6 ignores them), and then signs in to AWS only as they name, never with the AWS SDK's default chain.
- 5bdacf1: **Only the names a pack declares reach its code.** Before the pack's code loads, the pack service (TypeScript, Python, Java and Scala) drops from its environment every variable the pack doesn't declare in `env.required` or `env.optional`. A model key or a password in a self-hosted `--env-file`, meant for something else, no longer reaches a tool or a process a tool starts.
  
  - **What stays:** the declared names, `KINDGI_*`, and the platform's: the process's basics, the language runtime's settings, `PORT`, proxies and certificates, and Cloud Run's, AWS's and Azure's workload identity and metadata (`PLATFORM_ENV_NAMES`, `PLATFORM_ENV_PREFIXES`). Static credentials such as `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` aren't the platform's: a pack that needs one declares it.
  - **What it says:** one `warn` record at start, `env-dropped`, with the names it dropped, never their values. A Python image always names `GPG_KEY`, which its base image sets.
  - **The opt-out:** `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_FILTER=off` keeps every variable, as before. `kindgi dev` sets it, since there the pack service gets the app's env files. Any value other than `on` or `off` is a `config-invalid` start.
  - **Java and Scala:** a JVM can't drop a variable from its own environment, so the launcher (`kindgi-pack-java`) does, keeping the names in `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_DECLARED`, which `kindgi build` now sets in the image from the pack's index. The service won't start while a variable the pack doesn't declare still reaches it, or when `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_DECLARED` isn't the index's `env`.
  - **The skills** (tools and getting-started, every language) say so: an undeclared name works under `kindgi dev` and is unset once deployed, so declare every name the code reads.
  - **The conformance suite** checks it for every pack service: an undeclared variable is absent in a tool, the declared ones and the platform's are there, and `off` keeps it.
- 26882a9: Retired export keys: after the export signing key rotates, the old public keys can stay listed, so an export signed before still verifies with `kindgi exports verify --from-runtime`.
  - **`@kindgi/crypto`:** `parseRetiredExportKeys(pemBundle)` reads one or more PEM public keys (Ed25519 or EC P-256), under the ids their signers use. A private key, another kind of block, an unreadable block or another kind of key is refused, naming the block's position. `withRetiredExportKeys(binding, keys)` lists them after the binding's own keys; the active key and `sign` stay the binding's, so a retired key never signs.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_EXPORT_SIGNING_RETIRED_PUBLIC_KEYS_PATH` (a file of PEM public keys) and `KINDGI_EXPORT_SIGNING_RETIRED_PUBLIC_KEYS` (its base64), at most one. The runtime reads them; `GET /v1/export-signing-keys` then lists the retired keys after the active one, with `active: false`. Its response shape doesn't change.
- fdb86ae: Page cursors can be sealed. A list that hides rows the caller can't read after fetching them handed out its binding's cursor, a readable position that could name one of those rows (its id or time).
  
  - **What it does:** with `cursorSealer` (`createAeadCursorSealer`, AES-256-GCM), every list's cursors are sealed at the API's edge. A GET's sealed `cursor` opens to its position before any route reads it, and a JSON answer's `nextCursor` is sealed on its way out. A sealed cursor shows nothing of the row it points after.
  - **Where it opens:** only for the tenant, caller, list and filters it was handed out for, within a day. Otherwise `400 bad-input`, and the client starts again without it. The page size may change mid-scan. A plain cursor still passes.
  - **Keys:** each carries a `kid`. The first key seals and any listed key opens, so a key can rotate.
  - **Approvals:** with sealed cursors, `GET /v1/approvals` continues after the last approval it fetched once the page holds every one of that window the caller may read. A window of approvals the caller can't read no longer ends the paging: the page is empty, with `hasMore` and a cursor.
  - **Without a sealer:** cursors are the bindings' own, as before.
  - **The runtime's key:** `@kindgi/env-schema` lists `KINDGI_PAGINATION_KEY(_PATH)` and `KINDGI_PAGINATION_PREVIOUS_KEY(_PATH)` (for `--help` and the environment reference). Without a key, a cursor from before a restart answers 400 after it, and more than one instance needs the key. Keep the previous key at least a day after rotating, and rotate yearly. A cursor sealed with a key the runtime doesn't have says so (`unknown-key`). A list's filters bind as `[name, value]` pairs.
- 01958d4: The `secret-manager` secrets backend's settings: `KINDGI_SECRETS_MANAGER` (`azure`, `gcp` or `vault`; `aws` is read from runtime 0.1.7) picks your own secret manager, with `KINDGI_SECRETS_AZURE_VAULT_URL` (checked by `parseAzureVaultUrl`), `KINDGI_SECRETS_GCP_PROJECT_ID` (and, from runtime 0.1.7, `KINDGI_SECRETS_AWS_REGION`). `kindgi env init --secrets-backend=secret-manager --secrets-manager=<name>` writes them, and `--kms` is now for the `postgres` backend only. The secret-provider interface gains optional `providerVersion` fields, so Kindgi numbers secret versions itself whatever ids the provider uses.
- fdb86ae: An operator can manage sign-in alone. With `identityProviderChanges: 'operator'` (the runtime's `KINDGI_AUTH_TENANT_PROVIDERS=off`), a tenant can't add, change or remove its identity providers. `POST /v1/auth/providers`, `PATCH /v1/auth/providers/{providerId}` and `POST …/unregister` answer `403 identity-providers-operator-managed`: "This deployment's operator manages sign-in (KINDGI_AUTH_TENANT_PROVIDERS=off): identity providers can't be added, changed or removed here, except with the deployment's own token (KINDGI_API_TOKEN)." The deployment's own token (the `kindgi:system` capability) still can. Reading them is the same, and the providers there keep signing people in. `GET /v1/auth/providers` says which it is: an optional `changes`, `tenant` or `operator` (absent from older servers: read it as `tenant`). The TypeScript and Python clients read the new code as forbidden. `KINDGI_AUTH_TENANT_PROVIDERS` is in the environment schema (`on` by default).
- bbdccbb: An agent turn stops when its run is stopped. The runtime aborts a step's `abortSignal` when its run ends from outside: a cancel, or a shutdown that interrupts the runs it was executing. A turn's own work (its model call, its tool calls) listened only to the turn's abort, so a call in flight ran on until it answered.
  
  - **Now:** each step of a turn links the step's `abortSignal` to the turn's, so a call in flight is aborted at once, and the turn ends as aborted from outside (`agent-turn-aborted`, reason `external`).
  - **A wall-clock timeout keeps its own reason** (`timeout`).
  - **A cancelled turn's message stays plain:** `Agent turn cancelled`. The failure of the step its cancel aborted only restates the cancel, and is no longer appended as the turn's serialized failure. Any other words are kept.
  - **No API change.**
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`** lists `KINDGI_RUN_ENDED_CHECK_MS`: how often a server stops the runs it executes that were ended from outside, so a step that writes nothing for a while, such as a long model call, stops within this time of a cancel. Default 5000 ms; at least 1000.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 490d083: Artifacts belong to a project, and the capability catalog says what each feature means and which of your models have it.
  - **Artifacts (`/v1/artifacts`):**
    - Every artifact belongs to a project: its owner run's, else the upload's new `projectId`, else the tenant's default project. `BlobMeta` carries `projectId` and `createdBy`, and `BlobPutInput` takes them (both optional).
    - With authorization on, listing and downloading need `read` on that project, and uploading and deleting need `write`.
      - An artifact the caller can't read is `404`, as if absent.
      - A list shows only what the caller can read. `?projectId=` narrows it.
    - An upload naming an owner run that doesn't exist is `404 run-not-found`. A `projectId` that isn't the owner run's project is `400`.
    - The runtime caps an upload: `413 artifact-too-large`, with `details.maxBytes`. `CreateAppInput.artifactMaxBytes` sets it (default 100 MB).
  - **Retention domain `artifact`:** a retention policy can purge deleted artifacts after its grace.
  - **Capabilities:**
    - `FEATURE_DESCRIPTIONS` (`@kindgi/capabilities`) says in a line what each of the 13 features means.
    - A `CapabilityDescriptor` may carry `providers: [{providerId, models}]`, the tenant's providers with a model that has the feature (optional in the spec).
  - **TypeScript client:**
    - `artifacts.upload` (multipart), `download` (streamed bytes) and `head`; `list` takes `projectId`.
    - `put` and `get` (content-addressed `BlobRef`s) have no API route: they throw, pointing to `upload` and `download`.
    - `artifact-too-large` is an invalid request.
  - **Python client:** the new fields; a 413 is an `InvalidRequestError`.
  - **Runtime settings (`@kindgi/env-schema`):**
    - `KINDGI_ARTIFACTS` is `local:<absolute dir>` or `gcs:<bucket>[/<prefix>]`; it turns on `/v1/artifacts`.
    - `KINDGI_ARTIFACT_MAX_BYTES` sets the upload cap.
    - `kindgi dev` sets artifacts to the pack's `.kindgi/dev/artifacts`, which is gitignored.
  - **CLI:**
    - `kindgi artifacts list|get|upload|download|delete` and `kindgi capabilities list|get` work; before, they were hidden.
    - `artifacts head` is folded into `get`.
- f19bc64: **Upgrading: signing in to the console with an API token is now off by default, except in `kindgi dev`.** If people sign in to your console by pasting an API token, set `KINDGI_CONSOLE_TOKEN_SIGN_IN=on` on the runtime when you upgrade, or set up sign-in with your organization's identity provider. Otherwise the console's sign-in page offers no way in. API tokens keep working for the API, the CLI and the SDKs either way. `kindgi doctor` now warns when nobody can sign in to the console of the runtime it points at.
  
  - **`POST /v1/auth/token-sign-in`**: the API token in `Authorization` is exchanged once for a browser session in the session cookie (HttpOnly, the same as sign-in with an identity provider), so the browser never keeps the token. Only a person's full key opens a session: a service account's key, or a narrowed one (a `member` role, or one project), is refused 403 `token-sign-in-not-allowed`. The session ends after its lifetime, or when the key expires if sooner. 403 `token-sign-in-off` when the deployment doesn't allow it. TypeScript `client.auth.tokenSignIn()`. Enabled by `SessionConfig.tokenSignIn`; audited as `signed-in` (method `api-token`).
  - **`POST /v1/auth/logout`** is mounted with browser sessions even without identity providers, so a console signed in with a token can sign out.
  - **`GET /v1/auth/sign-in-options`** gains `methods: { identityProviders, apiToken }` (optional: absent from older servers), and is mounted whenever there's a way in, with or without identity providers.
  - **`SessionCookieOptions.sameOrigin`**: also accept a cookie request whose `Origin` names the host it was sent to (`Host`, or `X-Forwarded-Host`), for a deployment that doesn't know its public URL. The console is served by the runtime itself, and a cross-site page can't forge `Origin`.
  - **`KINDGI_CONSOLE_TOKEN_SIGN_IN`** (`@kindgi/env-schema`): `on` or `off`; default `off`, and `on` in `kindgi dev`.
  - **`kindgi doctor`**: a "Console sign-in" check for the runtime the CLI points at (`--url`, `KINDGI_API_URL`, `kindgi auth login`). It warns when token sign-in is off and no identity provider is set up, or none is registered, naming the setting that fixes it.
- b67c599: Memory erasure: the erasure ledger has its own key, `KINDGI_ERASURE_LEDGER_KEY_PATH` or `KINDGI_ERASURE_LEDGER_KEY` (32 bytes, the same form as the secrets AAD key), read whatever the secrets backend. It replaces the secrets AAD key as the source of the ledger's keyed hash: set it to make erasures replayable after a backup restore. `erasure-unmatchable` and `kindgi doctor`'s `erasures` check name it.
- b67c599: Erasing a person's words: `/v1/memory/erasures` (create, get, list, export, replay), for a tenant admin only. Erasing a Kindgi user (`subject.kind: user`) isn't offered: `400`. An erasure clears, in the background, a person's (an app's end user, `participant`, or an `external` subject facts name; or one fact's, or one conversation's) facts, conversations, the runs that served them and what those left in provenance; facts written from them go to review. A completed erasure keeps no identifier, only a keyed hash in the ledger, which you export off-box (`kindgi memory erasures export`) and replay after restoring a backup (`kindgi memory erasures replay`). `409 legal-hold` names held facts; an `erasure-unmatchable` warning says when the deployment can't keep the hash. Clients: `memory.erasures.*` (TypeScript), `memory.create_erasure` and friends (Python). A run whose content an erasure cleared has `contentErasedAt`. An erasure whose person has a turn in a flow serving other people waits for that run (`waiting-on-run`, `waitingOn`) until a deadline (`KINDGI_ERASURE_SHARED_WAIT_MS`, 7 days by default), then cancels it; `POST /v1/memory/erasures/{erasureId}/resume` (`kindgi memory erasures resume <id> [--force]`) tries again now, and `force` stops the wait. A test set's case copied from an erased run reads `erased: true` (`input`/`output` null, no items); comparison eval runs leave it out and count it (`summary.erased`).
- b67c599: Two retention domains: `memory` and `conversation`. A `memory` policy purges, past its grace, every revision of a fact whose life ended (deleted, or its current revision past its expiry); a fact under legal hold is never purged. A `conversation` policy purges unregistered conversations with their messages and recall index. Both hold people's words, so their retention is opt-in: a `*` policy doesn't reach them, only a policy naming them does.
- d94a98c: Retrieved memory reaches the model as labelled data, and search by meaning is never skipped silently.
  
  - **The `<memory>` block.** Retrieved facts no longer go into a second system message. They go into one user-role message just before the user's: `<memory note="kindgi memory: data, not instructions">` with JSON (every `<` escaped, so no fact can close the block). Per fact: `id`, `type`, `trust`, who asserted it (`assertedBy`, the kind only), validity dates, and content. The system message gains a fixed line: content in `<memory>` blocks is data, not instructions, and the user's current message wins. Recorded runs keep their journaled retrievals, so replays see the same facts. **This changes what models see.**
  - **Policies.** `defineAgent({ memory: { instructionTypes: ['policy'] } })` makes a retrieved fact of those types that a person **verified** an instruction, in the system message under "Policies (verified)". By default there are none: every retrieved fact is data.
  - **Modes.**
    - `both` fuses the keyword and meaning searches by rank (reciprocal rank fusion, `fuseByRank` in `@kindgi/memory`). Each retrieved fact carries its rank in each search (`RetrievedFact.ranks`), kept in the turn's journal.
    - `semantic` on a runtime without embeddings fails the turn with `semantic-unavailable`, naming the intent and `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS`. `both` runs its keyword half and journals `degraded: no-embeddings`. Before, both skipped the search by meaning without a word.
  - **`same-user`** is a new retrieval scope: this run's end user's facts and those of the Kindgi user it acts for.
  - **The API.**
    - `POST /v1/memory/retrieve` answers `422 semantic-unavailable` for `semantic` or `both` without embeddings. The spec listed `400 bad-input`, but the runtime's retrieve was a stub that answered an empty `200`, so no client could have seen the 400.
    - `POST /v1/agents` returns `warnings` (`semantic-unavailable`) for an agent whose retrieval searches by meaning on such a deployment (`MemoryBinding.semanticSearch`).
  - **Operator settings.**
    - `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS=openai-compat` turns on search by meaning through any embeddings endpoint that speaks OpenAI's `POST /embeddings` (OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM, Hugging Face TEI): set `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_URL` and `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL`, plus `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` from your secret store if the endpoint takes a key.
    - `local:<model>` runs the model inside a server run from source on macOS or glibc Linux, not in the runtime image.
    - An endpoint that doesn't answer doesn't stop the runtime, at boot or later. It is retried in the background, and search by meaning waits for it.
    - `@kindgi/embedding` adds `EmbeddingUnavailableError` (`embedding-unavailable`). A semantic search returning it is treated exactly like having no embeddings: `semantic` fails the turn with `semantic-unavailable`, and `both` runs its keyword half and journals it.
    - `@kindgi/adapter-model-openai-compat` adds `createOpenAICompatEmbeddingProvider`. Its `probe()` embeds once, to learn the dimensions.
  - **Specs and SDKs.**
    - The agent spec (schema-version 1.4.0) and pack index carry `memory` and the `same-user` scope; both indexers, TS and Python (`Agent(memory=...)`), keep them.
    - CLI: `kindgi memory facts retrieve --query=<json>` is wired.
- d898f33: `KINDGI_SEED_USER_ID`'s description says what a runtime from 0.1.5 does without it. The API token's user is kept across restarts while `KINDGI_API_TOKEN` stays the same, and a changed token gets a new user, with a warning at boot. Before, a new user came at every boot. Set it to keep one user across token changes.
- 646a906: **Signed exports work end to end: one export key, one envelope, and a verifier.** An approval's audit bundle, a run's provenance and compliance evidence are signed with the deployment's export key.
  
  - **The key:** `createApp({ exportSigning })` takes an `ExportSigningBinding` (`@kindgi/crypto`: async, so a KMS can back it; `createEd25519ExportSigner` for a key file). Key ids are derived from the public key (`ex_…`). The old `signingKey` still works, deprecated. On the runtime: `KINDGI_EXPORT_SIGNING_KEY_PATH`, `KINDGI_EXPORT_SIGNING_KEY` (base64 PEM, for Secret Manager) or the optional `KINDGI_EXPORT_SIGNING_KMS_KEY`; `kindgi dev` passes a key file through, or the runtime makes one.
  - **Two algorithms, chosen per key:** an Ed25519 key signs `ed25519` (the default); an EC P-256 key signs `ecdsa-p256-sha256`, for a key store without Ed25519 (a Cloud KMS `EC_SIGN_P256_SHA256` key, say). Its signature is IEEE P1363 `r‖s`. `createExportSignerFromPem` reads the algorithm from the key; `ecdsaDerToP1363` converts a KMS's DER signature. Both verifiers check either, and refuse an algorithm they don't know, naming it. Shared test vectors for both are in `@kindgi/specs` (`test-vectors/signed-export/`).
  - **One envelope:** the signed bytes (`bundle`), the signature, the public key, an optional `kind`, and `exportedAt`, which is now signed and the same in the envelope. Body versions: the audit bundle is `2.0.0` (a string; it was the integer `1`), provenance `1.2.0` (adds the signed `exportedAt`), compliance `1.0.0`.
  - **No body needed:** `signingKeyId` is optional (the active key), and an empty body reads as `{}`. **Behaviour change:** a `POST` to one of the three exports with no body, or without `signingKeyId`, used to answer `400 bad-input`; it now signs with the active key.
  - **Each export is recorded** as an `export-signed` audit event (who, what, which key, the SHA-256 of the signed bytes). An export whose record can't be written isn't handed out.
  - **`GET /v1/export-signing-keys`** lists the public keys to pin; `exportSigningKeys.list()` in the TS client.
  - **Verify:** `verifySignedExport` in `@kindgi/client` and `@kindgi/sdk/client` (Web Crypto); `approvals.audit.verify`, `provenance.verify` and `compliance.evidence.verify` now work. Python: `kindgi.exports.verify_signed_export` (`pip install 'kindgi[verify]'`). CLI: `kindgi exports verify <file> [--trust=<pem>] [--from-runtime]`.
  - **CLI:** `kindgi approvals export <approval-id>`; `kindgi provenance export`'s `--signing-key` is optional.
  - **Compliance:** `collectEvidence` builds an export's records, so the generator's `exportSigned` is optional and deprecated.
  - **Specs:** `signed-export.schema.json` (the envelope), and `audit-bundle.schema.json` 2.0.0 describes the bundle the API exports.
  - **Cloud Run module:** `export_signing = "secret" | "kms"` (opt-in).
- 7f55890: New runtime settings for "Continue with Google / Microsoft / GitHub" with the deployment's own apps: `KINDGI_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `KINDGI_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (or `…_SECRET_PATH`), and the same for `MICROSOFT` and `GITHUB`. People who've been added to a workspace sign in with that account, by its verified email. Google and Microsoft speak for a company's email only through the company's own accounts (a Google Workspace account of that domain, a Microsoft work account): a personal account made on a work address is refused. A Microsoft app needs the ID-token optional claims `email` and `xms_edov`; without `xms_edov`, Microsoft sign-ins are refused. On the domains of a workspace that signs its people in with its own identity provider, GitHub and the emailed link are not offered or accepted.
- 7a85bf6: New runtime settings for the emailed sign-in link: `KINDGI_AUTH_EMAIL_SMTP_URL` (or `…_PATH`) and `KINDGI_AUTH_EMAIL_FROM` turn it on. People who've been added to a workspace can then ask for a one-time link by email, valid for ten minutes. `KINDGI_AUTH_TURNSTILE_SECRET` (or `…_PATH`) with `KINDGI_AUTH_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` puts a Cloudflare Turnstile check on asking for one: optional on a runtime that serves one tenant, and required on one that serves several. Links to one address are limited: one a minute, 3 per 15 minutes (except for the browser that already got one), and `KINDGI_AUTH_EMAIL_LINK_DAILY_CAP` (default 20) a day from one client network.
- 66bab49: Sign-in contract for identity providers and browser sessions.
  
  - **Identity providers, one shape per `kind`.** `ProviderConfig` is a union: `oidc` (an OpenID Connect identity provider: `issuer` + `clientId` + `clientSecretRef`, endpoints from discovery), `saml` (IdP metadata XML, or entity ID + SSO URL + certificates; `spSigningKeyRef` / `spDecryptionKeyRef` by reference), and `oauth2` (a plain OAuth 2.0 provider that isn't OpenID Connect, e.g. GitHub: the old shape). All kinds gain `displayName`, `domains`, `join` and `signIn`. A `clientSecret` or raw key in the body is refused (400 `invalid-provider-config`), and the deployment may refuse a configuration it can't use (422 `identity-provider-invalid`). **TypeScript: narrow on `kind` before reading kind-specific fields** (`config.tokenEndpoint` needs `config.kind === 'oauth2'`, or `'oidc'` with endpoints).
  - **`GET /v1/auth/sign-in-options?email=`** (unauthenticated): the providers for the email's domain, each with a `signInUrl`. Sign-in is email first: with no email the list is empty, and the binding isn't asked. The same answer for anyone at a domain; rate-limited per client (429 `rate-limit-exceeded`). TypeScript `client.auth.signInOptions({ email })`. Backed by the optional `IdentityProviderBinding.signInOptions`.
  - **Browser sessions in a cookie** (`SessionConfig.cookie`): the session token is read from `__Host-kindgi_session` when there's no `Authorization` header; a cookie-authenticated unsafe request needs an allowed `Origin` (403 `csrf-origin-mismatch`, a missing `Origin` too). Logout clears the cookie; refresh of a cookie session is refused (400 `cookie-session-not-refreshable`).
  - **The provider catalog, refresh and logout mount without `exchangeCode`**; only this API's own OAuth flow (`/v1/auth/login` + callback) needs it.
  - **For `SessionStoreBinding` implementers:** `SessionCreateInput.accessToken` and `Session.accessToken` are optional (a deployment may keep no identity-provider tokens). Copy them conditionally.
  - **Runtime settings for sign-in** (`@kindgi/env-schema`): `KINDGI_AUTH_SECRET_PATH` / `KINDGI_AUTH_SECRET` (turn sign-in with identity providers on; need `KINDGI_PUBLIC_URL`), `KINDGI_AUTH_PRIVATE_IDP_ORIGINS` (private-network identity providers the operator allows), `KINDGI_SESSION_TTL_MS` (default 12 hours) and `KINDGI_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 60 minutes).
- 6dc2637: Sign-in finds a person's identity provider by their email's domain only once that domain is verified for a tenant. A runtime that serves one tenant routes that tenant's domains, as before. One that serves several routes a domain only once its operator lists it in the new `KINDGI_AUTH_VERIFIED_DOMAINS` (`acme.com:<tenant>`). Otherwise a tenant could list another company's domain and catch its people. `kindgi sso providers test` says so when a domain isn't routed.
- 280377e: **A tool's env values, per project (`ctx.env`).** A tool that declares names in `needsSpec.env` gets their values in `ctx.env` on each call: the call's project's value, else its org's, else the tenant's, in the env the runtime serves (`KINDGI_ENV`). A schema `default` makes a name optional. The values a call used are recorded with it (`ToolContext.record`, new: the step's durable record, set by the dispatch site), so the call re-run after a wait or a retry sees the same ones. A runtime that resolves them is needed; with an older one, `ctx.env` stays absent.
  
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:** `ToolContext.env`; `ToolContext.record`, which an agent turn's tool dispatch (`@kindgi/agents`) sets to its step's record under `tool-call:<call id>:<tool id>:<key>`; and `TypedNeeds` documents what `env` and `secrets` take (strings, checked by their schema; `config` is reserved).
  - **Pack protocol 2.5.0** (`@kindgi/specs`, `@kindgi/handler-runtime`, the Python SDK): `callContext.env` holds the declared names' string values. It's additive: a pack service that predates it already passes it through.
  - **`kindgi env set/list/unset --scope=tenant|org:<id>|project:<id> --env=<name>`** act on the runtime's env values (`/v1/env`). Without `--scope` they edit the pack's local env files, as before. `--env` is required with `--scope`. `set` refuses to change a value without `--force`, and warns about a name that looks like a credential. A runtime that doesn't serve `/v1/env` gets a plain message.
  - `kindgi env`'s description now says what it manages. It used to say values "resolve into `needs.env` at deploy time", which nothing did.
- 7a85bf6: New runtime setting `KINDGI_TRUSTED_PROXIES`: which proxies in front of the runtime to trust for a client's address, used by rate limits and audit records. Unset, the address is the connection's peer and `X-Forwarded-For` is ignored. Behind a load balancer or ingress, set a hop count (`1`) or your proxies' IPs/CIDR ranges. The client is then the first `X-Forwarded-For` hop from the right that isn't a trusted proxy, never the leftmost on its own. The sign-in options rate limit no longer keys on the leftmost `X-Forwarded-For` address, which a client can spoof: by default it uses the nearest hop.

## 0.1.5-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- 490d083: Artifacts belong to a project, and the capability catalog says what each feature means and which of your models have it.
  - **Artifacts (`/v1/artifacts`):**
    - Every artifact belongs to a project: its owner run's, else the upload's new `projectId`, else the tenant's default project. `BlobMeta` carries `projectId` and `createdBy`, and `BlobPutInput` takes them (both optional).
    - With authorization on, listing and downloading need `read` on that project, and uploading and deleting need `write`.
      - An artifact the caller can't read is `404`, as if absent.
      - A list shows only what the caller can read. `?projectId=` narrows it.
    - An upload naming an owner run that doesn't exist is `404 run-not-found`. A `projectId` that isn't the owner run's project is `400`.
    - The runtime caps an upload: `413 artifact-too-large`, with `details.maxBytes`. `CreateAppInput.artifactMaxBytes` sets it (default 100 MB).
  - **Retention domain `artifact`:** a retention policy can purge deleted artifacts after its grace.
  - **Capabilities:**
    - `FEATURE_DESCRIPTIONS` (`@kindgi/capabilities`) says in a line what each of the 13 features means.
    - A `CapabilityDescriptor` may carry `providers: [{providerId, models}]`, the tenant's providers with a model that has the feature (optional in the spec).
  - **TypeScript client:**
    - `artifacts.upload` (multipart), `download` (streamed bytes) and `head`; `list` takes `projectId`.
    - `put` and `get` (content-addressed `BlobRef`s) have no API route: they throw, pointing to `upload` and `download`.
    - `artifact-too-large` is an invalid request.
  - **Python client:** the new fields; a 413 is an `InvalidRequestError`.
  - **Runtime settings (`@kindgi/env-schema`):**
    - `KINDGI_ARTIFACTS` is `local:<absolute dir>` or `gcs:<bucket>[/<prefix>]`; it turns on `/v1/artifacts`.
    - `KINDGI_ARTIFACT_MAX_BYTES` sets the upload cap.
    - `kindgi dev` sets artifacts to the pack's `.kindgi/dev/artifacts`, which is gitignored.
  - **CLI:**
    - `kindgi artifacts list|get|upload|download|delete` and `kindgi capabilities list|get` work; before, they were hidden.
    - `artifacts head` is folded into `get`.
- f19bc64: **Upgrading: signing in to the console with an API token is now off by default, except in `kindgi dev`.** If people sign in to your console by pasting an API token, set `KINDGI_CONSOLE_TOKEN_SIGN_IN=on` on the runtime when you upgrade, or set up sign-in with your organization's identity provider. Otherwise the console's sign-in page offers no way in. API tokens keep working for the API, the CLI and the SDKs either way. `kindgi doctor` now warns when nobody can sign in to the console of the runtime it points at.
  
  - **`POST /v1/auth/token-sign-in`**: the API token in `Authorization` is exchanged once for a browser session in the session cookie (HttpOnly, the same as sign-in with an identity provider), so the browser never keeps the token. Only a person's full key opens a session: a service account's key, or a narrowed one (a `member` role, or one project), is refused 403 `token-sign-in-not-allowed`. The session ends after its lifetime, or when the key expires if sooner. 403 `token-sign-in-off` when the deployment doesn't allow it. TypeScript `client.auth.tokenSignIn()`. Enabled by `SessionConfig.tokenSignIn`; audited as `signed-in` (method `api-token`).
  - **`POST /v1/auth/logout`** is mounted with browser sessions even without identity providers, so a console signed in with a token can sign out.
  - **`GET /v1/auth/sign-in-options`** gains `methods: { identityProviders, apiToken }` (optional: absent from older servers), and is mounted whenever there's a way in, with or without identity providers.
  - **`SessionCookieOptions.sameOrigin`**: also accept a cookie request whose `Origin` names the host it was sent to (`Host`, or `X-Forwarded-Host`), for a deployment that doesn't know its public URL. The console is served by the runtime itself, and a cross-site page can't forge `Origin`.
  - **`KINDGI_CONSOLE_TOKEN_SIGN_IN`** (`@kindgi/env-schema`): `on` or `off`; default `off`, and `on` in `kindgi dev`.
  - **`kindgi doctor`**: a "Console sign-in" check for the runtime the CLI points at (`--url`, `KINDGI_API_URL`, `kindgi auth login`). It warns when token sign-in is off and no identity provider is set up, or none is registered, naming the setting that fixes it.
- b67c599: Memory erasure: the erasure ledger has its own key, `KINDGI_ERASURE_LEDGER_KEY_PATH` or `KINDGI_ERASURE_LEDGER_KEY` (32 bytes, the same form as the secrets AAD key), read whatever the secrets backend. It replaces the secrets AAD key as the source of the ledger's keyed hash: set it to make erasures replayable after a backup restore. `erasure-unmatchable` and `kindgi doctor`'s `erasures` check name it.
- b67c599: Erasing a person's words: `/v1/memory/erasures` (create, get, list, export, replay), for a tenant admin only. Erasing a Kindgi user (`subject.kind: user`) isn't offered: `400`. An erasure clears, in the background, a person's (an app's end user, `participant`, or an `external` subject facts name; or one fact's, or one conversation's) facts, conversations, the runs that served them and what those left in provenance; facts written from them go to review. A completed erasure keeps no identifier, only a keyed hash in the ledger, which you export off-box (`kindgi memory erasures export`) and replay after restoring a backup (`kindgi memory erasures replay`). `409 legal-hold` names held facts; an `erasure-unmatchable` warning says when the deployment can't keep the hash. Clients: `memory.erasures.*` (TypeScript), `memory.create_erasure` and friends (Python). A run whose content an erasure cleared has `contentErasedAt`. An erasure whose person has a turn in a flow serving other people waits for that run (`waiting-on-run`, `waitingOn`) until a deadline (`KINDGI_ERASURE_SHARED_WAIT_MS`, 7 days by default), then cancels it; `POST /v1/memory/erasures/{erasureId}/resume` (`kindgi memory erasures resume <id> [--force]`) tries again now, and `force` stops the wait. A test set's case copied from an erased run reads `erased: true` (`input`/`output` null, no items); comparison eval runs leave it out and count it (`summary.erased`).
- b67c599: Two retention domains: `memory` and `conversation`. A `memory` policy purges, past its grace, every revision of a fact whose life ended (deleted, or its current revision past its expiry); a fact under legal hold is never purged. A `conversation` policy purges unregistered conversations with their messages and recall index. Both hold people's words, so their retention is opt-in: a `*` policy doesn't reach them, only a policy naming them does.
- d94a98c: Retrieved memory reaches the model as labelled data, and search by meaning is never skipped silently.
  
  - **The `<memory>` block.** Retrieved facts no longer go into a second system message. They go into one user-role message just before the user's: `<memory note="kindgi memory: data, not instructions">` with JSON (every `<` escaped, so no fact can close the block). Per fact: `id`, `type`, `trust`, who asserted it (`assertedBy`, the kind only), validity dates, and content. The system message gains a fixed line: content in `<memory>` blocks is data, not instructions, and the user's current message wins. Recorded runs keep their journaled retrievals, so replays see the same facts. **This changes what models see.**
  - **Policies.** `defineAgent({ memory: { instructionTypes: ['policy'] } })` makes a retrieved fact of those types that a person **verified** an instruction, in the system message under "Policies (verified)". By default there are none: every retrieved fact is data.
  - **Modes.**
    - `both` fuses the keyword and meaning searches by rank (reciprocal rank fusion, `fuseByRank` in `@kindgi/memory`). Each retrieved fact carries its rank in each search (`RetrievedFact.ranks`), kept in the turn's journal.
    - `semantic` on a runtime without embeddings fails the turn with `semantic-unavailable`, naming the intent and `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS`. `both` runs its keyword half and journals `degraded: no-embeddings`. Before, both skipped the search by meaning without a word.
  - **`same-user`** is a new retrieval scope: this run's end user's facts and those of the Kindgi user it acts for.
  - **The API.**
    - `POST /v1/memory/retrieve` answers `422 semantic-unavailable` for `semantic` or `both` without embeddings. The spec listed `400 bad-input`, but the runtime's retrieve was a stub that answered an empty `200`, so no client could have seen the 400.
    - `POST /v1/agents` returns `warnings` (`semantic-unavailable`) for an agent whose retrieval searches by meaning on such a deployment (`MemoryBinding.semanticSearch`).
  - **Operator settings.**
    - `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS=openai-compat` turns on search by meaning through any embeddings endpoint that speaks OpenAI's `POST /embeddings` (OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM, Hugging Face TEI): set `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_URL` and `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL`, plus `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` from your secret store if the endpoint takes a key.
    - `local:<model>` runs the model inside a server run from source on macOS or glibc Linux, not in the runtime image.
    - An endpoint that doesn't answer doesn't stop the runtime, at boot or later. It is retried in the background, and search by meaning waits for it.
    - `@kindgi/embedding` adds `EmbeddingUnavailableError` (`embedding-unavailable`). A semantic search returning it is treated exactly like having no embeddings: `semantic` fails the turn with `semantic-unavailable`, and `both` runs its keyword half and journals it.
    - `@kindgi/adapter-model-openai-compat` adds `createOpenAICompatEmbeddingProvider`. Its `probe()` embeds once, to learn the dimensions.
  - **Specs and SDKs.**
    - The agent spec (schema-version 1.4.0) and pack index carry `memory` and the `same-user` scope; both indexers, TS and Python (`Agent(memory=...)`), keep them.
    - CLI: `kindgi memory facts retrieve --query=<json>` is wired.
- d898f33: `KINDGI_SEED_USER_ID`'s description says what a runtime from 0.1.5 does without it. The API token's user is kept across restarts while `KINDGI_API_TOKEN` stays the same, and a changed token gets a new user, with a warning at boot. Before, a new user came at every boot. Set it to keep one user across token changes.
- 646a906: **Signed exports work end to end: one export key, one envelope, and a verifier.** An approval's audit bundle, a run's provenance and compliance evidence are signed with the deployment's export key.
  
  - **The key:** `createApp({ exportSigning })` takes an `ExportSigningBinding` (`@kindgi/crypto`: async, so a KMS can back it; `createEd25519ExportSigner` for a key file). Key ids are derived from the public key (`ex_…`). The old `signingKey` still works, deprecated. On the runtime: `KINDGI_EXPORT_SIGNING_KEY_PATH`, `KINDGI_EXPORT_SIGNING_KEY` (base64 PEM, for Secret Manager) or the optional `KINDGI_EXPORT_SIGNING_KMS_KEY`; `kindgi dev` passes a key file through, or the runtime makes one.
  - **Two algorithms, chosen per key:** an Ed25519 key signs `ed25519` (the default); an EC P-256 key signs `ecdsa-p256-sha256`, for a key store without Ed25519 (a Cloud KMS `EC_SIGN_P256_SHA256` key, say). Its signature is IEEE P1363 `r‖s`. `createExportSignerFromPem` reads the algorithm from the key; `ecdsaDerToP1363` converts a KMS's DER signature. Both verifiers check either, and refuse an algorithm they don't know, naming it. Shared test vectors for both are in `@kindgi/specs` (`test-vectors/signed-export/`).
  - **One envelope:** the signed bytes (`bundle`), the signature, the public key, an optional `kind`, and `exportedAt`, which is now signed and the same in the envelope. Body versions: the audit bundle is `2.0.0` (a string; it was the integer `1`), provenance `1.2.0` (adds the signed `exportedAt`), compliance `1.0.0`.
  - **No body needed:** `signingKeyId` is optional (the active key), and an empty body reads as `{}`. **Behaviour change:** a `POST` to one of the three exports with no body, or without `signingKeyId`, used to answer `400 bad-input`; it now signs with the active key.
  - **Each export is recorded** as an `export-signed` audit event (who, what, which key, the SHA-256 of the signed bytes). An export whose record can't be written isn't handed out.
  - **`GET /v1/export-signing-keys`** lists the public keys to pin; `exportSigningKeys.list()` in the TS client.
  - **Verify:** `verifySignedExport` in `@kindgi/client` and `@kindgi/sdk/client` (Web Crypto); `approvals.audit.verify`, `provenance.verify` and `compliance.evidence.verify` now work. Python: `kindgi.exports.verify_signed_export` (`pip install 'kindgi[verify]'`). CLI: `kindgi exports verify <file> [--trust=<pem>] [--from-runtime]`.
  - **CLI:** `kindgi approvals export <approval-id>`; `kindgi provenance export`'s `--signing-key` is optional.
  - **Compliance:** `collectEvidence` builds an export's records, so the generator's `exportSigned` is optional and deprecated.
  - **Specs:** `signed-export.schema.json` (the envelope), and `audit-bundle.schema.json` 2.0.0 describes the bundle the API exports.
  - **Cloud Run module:** `export_signing = "secret" | "kms"` (opt-in).
- 7f55890: New runtime settings for "Continue with Google / Microsoft / GitHub" with the deployment's own apps: `KINDGI_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `KINDGI_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (or `…_SECRET_PATH`), and the same for `MICROSOFT` and `GITHUB`. People who've been added to a workspace sign in with that account, by its verified email. Google and Microsoft speak for a company's email only through the company's own accounts (a Google Workspace account of that domain, a Microsoft work account): a personal account made on a work address is refused. A Microsoft app needs the ID-token optional claims `email` and `xms_edov`; without `xms_edov`, Microsoft sign-ins are refused. On the domains of a workspace that signs its people in with its own identity provider, GitHub and the emailed link are not offered or accepted.
- 7a85bf6: New runtime settings for the emailed sign-in link: `KINDGI_AUTH_EMAIL_SMTP_URL` (or `…_PATH`) and `KINDGI_AUTH_EMAIL_FROM` turn it on. People who've been added to a workspace can then ask for a one-time link by email, valid for ten minutes. `KINDGI_AUTH_TURNSTILE_SECRET` (or `…_PATH`) with `KINDGI_AUTH_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` puts a Cloudflare Turnstile check on asking for one: optional on a runtime that serves one tenant, and required on one that serves several. Links to one address are limited: one a minute, 3 per 15 minutes (except for the browser that already got one), and `KINDGI_AUTH_EMAIL_LINK_DAILY_CAP` (default 20) a day from one client network.
- 66bab49: Sign-in contract for identity providers and browser sessions.
  
  - **Identity providers, one shape per `kind`.** `ProviderConfig` is a union: `oidc` (an OpenID Connect identity provider: `issuer` + `clientId` + `clientSecretRef`, endpoints from discovery), `saml` (IdP metadata XML, or entity ID + SSO URL + certificates; `spSigningKeyRef` / `spDecryptionKeyRef` by reference), and `oauth2` (a plain OAuth 2.0 provider that isn't OpenID Connect, e.g. GitHub: the old shape). All kinds gain `displayName`, `domains`, `join` and `signIn`. A `clientSecret` or raw key in the body is refused (400 `invalid-provider-config`), and the deployment may refuse a configuration it can't use (422 `identity-provider-invalid`). **TypeScript: narrow on `kind` before reading kind-specific fields** (`config.tokenEndpoint` needs `config.kind === 'oauth2'`, or `'oidc'` with endpoints).
  - **`GET /v1/auth/sign-in-options?email=`** (unauthenticated): the providers for the email's domain, each with a `signInUrl`. Sign-in is email first: with no email the list is empty, and the binding isn't asked. The same answer for anyone at a domain; rate-limited per client (429 `rate-limit-exceeded`). TypeScript `client.auth.signInOptions({ email })`. Backed by the optional `IdentityProviderBinding.signInOptions`.
  - **Browser sessions in a cookie** (`SessionConfig.cookie`): the session token is read from `__Host-kindgi_session` when there's no `Authorization` header; a cookie-authenticated unsafe request needs an allowed `Origin` (403 `csrf-origin-mismatch`, a missing `Origin` too). Logout clears the cookie; refresh of a cookie session is refused (400 `cookie-session-not-refreshable`).
  - **The provider catalog, refresh and logout mount without `exchangeCode`**; only this API's own OAuth flow (`/v1/auth/login` + callback) needs it.
  - **For `SessionStoreBinding` implementers:** `SessionCreateInput.accessToken` and `Session.accessToken` are optional (a deployment may keep no identity-provider tokens). Copy them conditionally.
  - **Runtime settings for sign-in** (`@kindgi/env-schema`): `KINDGI_AUTH_SECRET_PATH` / `KINDGI_AUTH_SECRET` (turn sign-in with identity providers on; need `KINDGI_PUBLIC_URL`), `KINDGI_AUTH_PRIVATE_IDP_ORIGINS` (private-network identity providers the operator allows), `KINDGI_SESSION_TTL_MS` (default 12 hours) and `KINDGI_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 60 minutes).
- 6dc2637: Sign-in finds a person's identity provider by their email's domain only once that domain is verified for a tenant. A runtime that serves one tenant routes that tenant's domains, as before. One that serves several routes a domain only once its operator lists it in the new `KINDGI_AUTH_VERIFIED_DOMAINS` (`acme.com:<tenant>`). Otherwise a tenant could list another company's domain and catch its people. `kindgi sso providers test` says so when a domain isn't routed.
- 280377e: **A tool's env values, per project (`ctx.env`).** A tool that declares names in `needsSpec.env` gets their values in `ctx.env` on each call: the call's project's value, else its org's, else the tenant's, in the env the runtime serves (`KINDGI_ENV`). A schema `default` makes a name optional. The values a call used are recorded with it (`ToolContext.record`, new: the step's durable record, set by the dispatch site), so the call re-run after a wait or a retry sees the same ones. A runtime that resolves them is needed; with an older one, `ctx.env` stays absent.
  
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:** `ToolContext.env`; `ToolContext.record`, which an agent turn's tool dispatch (`@kindgi/agents`) sets to its step's record under `tool-call:<call id>:<tool id>:<key>`; and `TypedNeeds` documents what `env` and `secrets` take (strings, checked by their schema; `config` is reserved).
  - **Pack protocol 2.5.0** (`@kindgi/specs`, `@kindgi/handler-runtime`, the Python SDK): `callContext.env` holds the declared names' string values. It's additive: a pack service that predates it already passes it through.
  - **`kindgi env set/list/unset --scope=tenant|org:<id>|project:<id> --env=<name>`** act on the runtime's env values (`/v1/env`). Without `--scope` they edit the pack's local env files, as before. `--env` is required with `--scope`. `set` refuses to change a value without `--force`, and warns about a name that looks like a credential. A runtime that doesn't serve `/v1/env` gets a plain message.
  - `kindgi env`'s description now says what it manages. It used to say values "resolve into `needs.env` at deploy time", which nothing did.
- 7a85bf6: New runtime setting `KINDGI_TRUSTED_PROXIES`: which proxies in front of the runtime to trust for a client's address, used by rate limits and audit records. Unset, the address is the connection's peer and `X-Forwarded-For` is ignored. Behind a load balancer or ingress, set a hop count (`1`) or your proxies' IPs/CIDR ranges. The client is then the first `X-Forwarded-For` hop from the right that isn't a trusted proxy, never the leftmost on its own. The sign-in options rate limit no longer keys on the leftmost `X-Forwarded-For` address, which a client can spoof: by default it uses the nearest hop.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 149a8c9: **`KINDGI_COMPLIANCE_CLASSIFIER` turns on the audit trail's compliance features**, off by default. Set it to `shipped` (the classifier the runtime ships) or to the absolute path of your own classifier JSON. When set, the runtime serves `/v1/compliance/*` and **purges audit events by kind, as the classifier says**.
  
  With `shipped`:
  
  | Audit events | Purged after |
  |---|---|
  | Authorization decisions | 90 days |
  | Authorization denials | 365 days |
  | Run outcomes and guardrail violations | 730 days |
  | Secret changes and approval decisions | never (legal hold) |
  | Kinds the classifier doesn't list | never |
  
  Unset: no `/v1/compliance/*`, and no audit event is ever purged.
  
  `AuditEventPurgeInput` gains optional `outcome` / `exceptOutcome`, so a kind's denials can be kept longer than the rest (a classifier's `onDenyDays`). The in-memory binding honors both.
- 846dd9c: `KINDGI_RUN_LEASE_MS` and `KINDGI_RUN_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS` say they cover eval runs too: a running eval run holds the same executor lease, and when its server stops without a shutdown, the sweep ends it `failed`, interrupted, with its finished cases kept.
- c0f1b56: `KINDGI_PUBLIC_URL`: the URL clients reach the runtime at, when it isn't the address the server binds (behind a proxy, or a container whose port is published on another one). The runtime's startup banner names it, with its docs and console links. `kindgi dev` sets it, so the banner shows the port `kindgi dev` chose, e.g. 4001 when 4000 was taken, not the container's 4000. `parsePublicUrl` validates it; a runtime that doesn't read it keeps working.
- 9801f64: **Request logs and trace context.**
  
  - **`createApp({ logger })`** takes a `@kindgi/log` logger. Without one, the app stays quiet.
    - Each request gets `c.var.log`, with subsystem `http` and its `requestId`, `traceId` and `spanId` (plus `tenantId` once authenticated), and `c.var.trace`.
    - An incoming `traceparent` is honoured, with a new span; a missing or malformed one starts a fresh trace. Every response answers `traceresponse`.
  - **The access line:** `METHOD /v1/runs/:runId 200 12ms`, with the route's pattern and never the raw path.
    - Writes and 4xx are logged at `info`, 5xx at `error`.
    - Successful reads, probes and stream openings are logged at `debug`, so `info` stays readable while a console polls.
    - A 500 also logs the error itself, redacted.
  - **Runs carry their trace.** Starting a run hands the request's trace to the run handler (`RunTrace` on the agent and flow invoke inputs). `RunFlowInput`, `StartRunParams` and `KernelRunRecord` take an optional `traceId`. `Run.traceId` is on the wire when a run has one: optional in the TypeScript client, `trace_id` in the Python client.
  - **Pack protocol 2.4.1:** the optional `traceparent` request header (`PACK_HEADERS.traceparent`), so a pack service's records can carry the run's trace id.
  - **`KINDGI_LOG_LEVEL`, `KINDGI_LOG_LEVELS` and `KINDGI_LOG_FORMAT`** are in the env schema, for the runtime server. Under `auto`, the format is pretty on a terminal or with `KINDGI_DEV=true`.
  - **`kindgi dev`** runs the runtime with pretty logs (`KINDGI_LOG_FORMAT=pretty`) and keeps only its last 200 lines in memory.
- 7c084e1: New server setting `KINDGI_RETENTION_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS`, off by default: when set, the runtime purges deleted rows on its own on that interval, in every tenant it serves. It purges the tombstones past their retention policy's grace, as `POST /v1/retention/sweep` does, keeps holds (`graceSeconds: -1`), and logs what it purged. Unset, nothing purges on its own, as before. At least 60000 (one minute).

  With `shipped`:
  
  | Audit events | Purged after |
  |---|---|
  | Authorization decisions | 90 days |
  | Authorization denials | 365 days |
  | Run outcomes and guardrail violations | 730 days |
  | Secret changes and approval decisions | never (legal hold) |
  | Kinds the classifier doesn't list | never |
  
  Unset: no `/v1/compliance/*`, and no audit event is ever purged.
  
  `AuditEventPurgeInput` gains optional `outcome` / `exceptOutcome`, so a kind's denials can be kept longer than the rest (a classifier's `onDenyDays`). The in-memory binding honors both.
- 7c084e1: New server setting `KINDGI_RETENTION_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS`, off by default: when set, the runtime purges deleted rows on its own on that interval, in every tenant it serves. It purges the tombstones past their retention policy's grace, as `POST /v1/retention/sweep` does, keeps holds (`graceSeconds: -1`), and logs what it purged. Unset, nothing purges on its own, as before. At least 60000 (one minute).

## 0.1.4-rc.1

### Patch Changes

- 846dd9c: `KINDGI_RUN_LEASE_MS` and `KINDGI_RUN_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS` say they cover eval runs too: a running eval run holds the same executor lease, and when its server stops without a shutdown, the sweep ends it `failed`, interrupted, with its finished cases kept.
- c0f1b56: `KINDGI_PUBLIC_URL`: the URL clients reach the runtime at, when it isn't the address the server binds (behind a proxy, or a container whose port is published on another one). The runtime's startup banner names it, with its docs and console links. `kindgi dev` sets it, so the banner shows the port `kindgi dev` chose, e.g. 4001 when 4000 was taken, not the container's 4000. `parsePublicUrl` validates it; a runtime that doesn't read it keeps working.

## 0.1.4-rc.0

No changes in this release.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 4ed3d2f: CLI fixes from a pilot's feedback, and the runtime's port order.
  
  - **`kindgi runs start` never loses the run.** It starts the run in the background and follows it, rather than holding the start request open. A long agent turn no longer times out the CLI with no run id to look it up by. It still waits until the run finishes or waits on an approval, and prints the same record. A stopped wait (Ctrl+C) prints `Stopped waiting. Run <id> goes on: kindgi runs get <id>`.
  - **The Gemini preset uses the models' real output limit:** 65,536 tokens for Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash, thinking included. It used to cap Pro at 8192. `kindgi providers register --preset=<name> --max-output-tokens=<n>` sets another cap.
  - **`kindgi env plan --format=gcloud` emits `--update-env-vars` / `--update-secrets`.** They add or replace the names listed and leave the service's other variables alone. `--set-*` replaced the whole env.
  - **`KINDGI_API_PORT`'s description states the port order.** The runtime takes the first that's set: the `--port` flag, `KINDGI_API_PORT`, the platform's `PORT` (Cloud Run, Render, Heroku and Fly set it), the config file's `port`, then 4000.
- 2c185d8: Fixes from the first Cloud Run deployment.
  
  - **The pack service token is read the same way on both sides.** `parsePackServiceToken` (new in `@kindgi/env-schema`) drops surrounding whitespace, so a secret stored with a trailing newline no longer makes every pack call answer 401. A token with whitespace or a control character inside is refused at startup, since an HTTP header can't carry it. The Node pack service and the Python one (`kindgi.pack.serve`) both use the rule, and the pack conformance suite checks it.
  - **Refusals aren't replayed.** The idempotency middleware stores a response only when the request took effect (a status below 400). A request retried with the same `Idempotency-Key` after a refusal (4xx) or a failure (5xx) runs again, so a deploy retried after trusting its key now goes through.
  - **`kindgi deploy` says when an answer is a replay** (`X-Idempotent-Replay`) and how to retry: `--idempotency-key <new value>` for a replayed refusal from an older runtime. A refused signing key's hint gives the `kindgi key trust <keyId> --url <endpoint>` command on a line of its own. The retry advice for server errors and network failures is reworded.
- 66e7ac2: `KINDGI_WEBHOOK_PRIVATE_NETWORKS` (`allow` | `deny`, default `deny`): a self-hosted runtime's webhooks may go to a receiver on its own private network, at an RFC 1918, CGNAT (100.64.0.0/10) or IPv6 unique-local address. Loopback, link-local (the cloud metadata endpoints) and unroutable addresses stay refused, and webhooks stay https only. The runtime reads it from 0.1.3.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- fde369b: The local key for secrets (`KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND_KMS=libsodium`): `KINDGI_SECRETS_LOCAL_KEY_PATH` or `KINDGI_SECRETS_LOCAL_KEY`, and `KINDGI_SECRETS_LOCAL_KEY_ACK` (required, exactly `single-node`). A self-hosted runtime without a cloud KMS can keep secrets in Postgres with a key it holds; `KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND_KMS` lists `libsodium` as supported.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- d00fc1b: **The executor lease's timings, for operators.** The runtime fails a run whose server stopped without a shutdown (killed, out of memory, a crash) once the run's lease runs out, and sends `run.finished`. Two `core` variables set how fast:
  
  - `KINDGI_RUN_LEASE_MS`: how long a run's lease lasts without renewal (default 300000, 5 minutes; at least 10000). The server executing the run renews it every quarter of this.
  - `KINDGI_RUN_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS`: how often each server sweeps for runs whose lease ran out (default 60000; at least 1000, and shorter than the lease).
  
  Out-of-range values stop the server at startup. Such a run is failed within about a lease plus one sweep.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: A deployment's tools and guardrails keep where their code is, and the trust list it's verified against gets routes.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`, `POST /v1/deployments`:**
    - **What registers is the signed image's index.** The server reads `/app/index.json` from the image, checks it hashes to the signed `indexHash`, and registers what it declares. The request body no longer carries `index`. Before, the route validated and registered the body's copy, which no signature covers, so a replayed request could register tools the image never shipped. The image's index must also name the signed `artifactVersion` (`400 image-unverifiable` otherwise).
    - **The code pointer.** A tool's `modulePath` and a guardrail's `checkModulePath` become `codeArtifactRef: { kind: 'oci', imageRef, modulePath, artifactVersion }`, pointing into the deployed image. Before, they were stripped, so a deployed pack tool had no code the runtime could reach.
    - **What a deployment shipped.** The record gains `contents`: each tool's, agent's and flow's `{ id, version }`, and each guardrail's `{ id }`. `DeploymentRegisterInput` and `Deployment` carry it; it's required, so a `DeploymentBinding` stores it. Versions are immutable and a digest deploys once, so the latest deployment is the live one. A rollback rolls forward: deploy the earlier code again under new versions.
    - **The catalog caches hear of it.** A new deployment calls `onToolWrite` / `onGuardrailWrite` for each tool and guardrail it registered, as `POST /v1/tools` and `POST /v1/guardrails` do, so a runtime's tool and guardrail bridges see it at once. `DeploymentContents` and `DeployedPrimitive` are exported.
    - **Indexed guardrails deploy.** A guardrail's `checkId` becomes its `check`, and the index-only `configSchema` is dropped, as `kindgi dev` maps them. Before, every guardrail the indexer writes failed validation.
  - **`@kindgi/api`, `/v1/signing-keys`:** the tenant's trusted signing keys, the public keys whose deployments verify. Mounted when `signingKeyRegistry` is passed, on its own, without the deployments route.
    - `POST /v1/signing-keys` trusts a key: `keyId`, `publicKey` (base64 Ed25519), `label?`. It returns `201`, or `200` for the same key again. A known id with another key is `409 signing-key-conflict`; rotate under a new id.
    - `GET /v1/signing-keys` lists the active keys (`?includeRevoked=true`, `?label=` prefix). `GET /v1/signing-keys/{keyId}` returns one key, revoked or not.
    - `POST /v1/signing-keys/{keyId}/revoke` takes an optional `reason`. A revoked key stays readable for audit and verifies no new deployments.
    - Writes need the `signing-keys:write` capability.
    - Revocation is final: trusting a revoked key id again is `409 signing-key-revoked`.
    - New error codes: `signing-key-conflict` (409), `signing-key-revoked` (409), `signing-key-algorithm-unsupported` (400), `signing-key-store-error` (500).
  - **`@kindgi/client`:** `client.signingKeys` (`trust`, `list`, `get`, `revoke`); `deployments.register` takes no `index`. The Python client's models and resources follow.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** the `image-registry` group, how the server reads deployment images: `KINDGI_IMAGE_REGISTRY_HOST`, `_USERNAME`, `_PASSWORD` (credentials for one host, all three or none) and `_INSECURE_HOSTS` (hosts reached over plain HTTP).
- aec851d: `KINDGI_DEV_HOST_ALIAS` (development only): where the server's outbound calls to a loopback address connect instead. Inside a container, loopback is the container itself, so webhooks to the app, HTTP MCP endpoints, a model provider and the pack service on the developer's machine would all miss. `kindgi dev` sets `host.docker.internal` on Docker Desktop. The URL, the `Host` header and the TLS server name stay as written; only the connection goes to the alias.
- aec851d: The server binary's development settings, so `kindgi dev` can run the runtime as a container:
  
  - `KINDGI_API_HOST` (core): the address the API server binds. Default: all interfaces. `127.0.0.1` keeps it off the network.
  - `KINDGI_PACK_DIR` (development only): the pack directory `kindgi dev` runs. The server reads the pack's primitives from the index `kindgi dev` writes there (`.kindgi/dev/index.json`) instead of from Postgres, and signed deployments are off.
  - `KINDGI_DEV_CONSOLE_LOGIN` (development only): the console logs in by itself through `GET /__dev/bearer`, which answers loopback hosts only.
  
  The development settings form a new `dev` group, listed last in `.env.example`. `KINDGI_DEV`'s description now names them.
- aec851d: `KINDGI_LICENSE_KEY`: the commercial license key (`kgi_lk_...`) the server checks offline at startup outside development mode. Without a valid key, a server that isn't in development mode refuses to start; `KINDGI_DEV=true` needs none. `LICENSE_KEY_VAR` names it.
- aec851d: `parseCorsOrigins`, `CORS_ORIGINS_VAR` and `PUBLIC_TOKEN_KEY_PATH_VAR`: the check for `KINDGI_CORS_ORIGINS` (exact origins: a scheme, a host and an optional port; no path or wildcard), so the server and the CLI refuse the same values with the same message.
- aec851d: A pack declares the process environment its code reads, and the pack service says what's missing.
  
  - **`kindgi.config`** takes `env: { required?, optional? }`: the names the pack's code reads from `process.env`. The indexer validates them (environment variable names, no `KINDGI_*`, no name twice) and writes them, sorted, into `index.json` as `env`, which is absent when nothing is declared. A malformed declaration fails indexing as `config-invalid`. `resolvePackEnv` and `missingPackEnv` are exported for tools that check the same thing.
  - **The pack service**, with a required name unset or empty, isn't ready: `/readyz` and every call answer 503 `{ "error": "missing env", "missingEnv": [...] }`, names only. `/v1/info` always lists `missingEnv`, and the names are logged once at startup (`missing-env`). `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_CHECK=warn` serves anyway; anything other than `strict` (the default) or `warn` fails startup.
  - **`@kindgi/specs`:** `pack-index.schema.json` 1.4.0 adds the optional `env`; `pack-protocol.schema.json` 2.2.0 adds the optional `missingEnv` to `info`. The Python SDK's vendored copies match.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_CHECK` (component `pack-service`).
  - **`@kindgi/pack-conformance`:** cases for the declared env, and `unsupported` on a target, which skips the cases for a part of the contract it hasn't implemented yet.
  - **The `kindgi-authoring-tools` skill** says to declare the names a tool reads.
- aec851d: The pack service's variables, and the server's for reaching it.
  
  - **The `component` axis.** `EnvTarget.component` is `server` (the default) or `pack-service`, the separate process that runs a pack's code. The server's vars don't apply to the pack service's target.
  - **The `packTransport` axis.** `EnvTarget.packTransport: 'http'` is set when the server calls a pack service at `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_URL`. Its token is then required.
  - **New vars,** in a new `pack-service` group:
    - `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_URL`: the server's address for the pack service. Unset, no pack code runs.
    - `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_TOKEN`: the secret shared by the server and the pack service. Required by the pack service, and by the server with an HTTP pack transport.
    - `KINDGI_PACK_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS`: how long one pack call may take (default 120000).
    - `KINDGI_PACK_INDEX` and `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_MAX_CONCURRENCY`: the pack service's index path (default `/app/index.json`) and call cap (default 32). The pack service already reads both; they're declared here now.
- aec851d: What a server on Cloud Run needs to reach its pack service and images, and to take its keys without files:
  
  - `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_AUTH`: `token` (default) | `google-id-token`, which also sends a Google ID token for an IAM-protected pack service.
  - `KINDGI_IMAGE_REGISTRY_AUTH`: `static` (default, the username and password) | `google`, the server's own Google identity for Artifact Registry.
  - `KINDGI_SECRETS_AAD_KEY` and `KINDGI_PUBLIC_TOKEN_SIGNING_KEY`: the key material itself, base64, as the alternative to the `_PATH` variables (one or the other, not both) for platforms that give secrets as environment variables. `KINDGI_SECRETS_AAD_KEY_PATH` is no longer required on its own: the postgres backend needs one of the two. `PUBLIC_TOKEN_KEY_VAR` names the new signing-key variable.
- aec851d: What a tenant registers can no longer reach the server's own host unless the deployment allows it, and MCP endpoints authenticate through the secrets store.
  
  - **`KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS`** (`@kindgi/env-schema`): `deployed` refuses a `stdio` MCP endpoint, a command the server would run in its container as its user. `local` allows it, for a machine where every token holder may run commands. Unset, it's `local` under `KINDGI_DEV` and `deployed` otherwise.
  - **`@kindgi/api`:**
    - `createApp` takes `tenantHostAccess` (default `deployed`). Under `deployed`, registering a `stdio` endpoint answers `403 host-access-denied`, a new error code.
    - `deniesHostReach`, `parseTenantHostAccess`, `TENANT_HOST_ACCESS_LEVELS` and `stdioRefusal` are exported for the runtime's connect-time check. Checks ask `deniesHostReach(level, reach)`, so a stricter level is one more row.
    - `mcpRouter` takes the level as a fourth argument.
  - **`MCPEndpoint.secretRef: { envName, name }` replaces `authRef`.** It's a secret by name in the deployment's store, resolved at the endpoint's tenant scope, the shape webhooks and providers use.
    - `env:NAME` references, which read the server's own environment, are gone.
    - The register body now refuses unknown fields, so an `authRef` is a `400` (`unknown-field`), not silently dropped.
    - The webhook routes and MCP share one `secretRef` parser.
  - **`@kindgi/client`:** `McpEndpoint` and `RegisterMcpEndpointInput` take `secretRef` (`McpEndpointSecretRef`). The Python `kindgi.client` is regenerated: `secret_ref` replaces `auth_ref`.
- aec851d: Tool secrets reach the tools that declare them.
  
  - `@kindgi/env-schema`: `KINDGI_ENV`, the env a runtime serves. Secrets a tool declares by name (`needsSpec.secrets`) resolve under it; development mode defaults it to `local`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries a declarative tool's `spec` (`defineTool({ spec })`) into `index.json`, so the runtime runs the tool itself and resolves its `secretRef`s, instead of the pack service running it without them.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `pack-index.schema.json` 1.2.0 adds a tool's optional `spec`. The Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the `kindgi-python-authoring-tools` skill — and the Python SDK's README and `ToolContext.secrets` docstring — say how to declare a secret (`needs_spec={"secrets": …}`) and read it from `ctx.secrets`; `ctx.env` and `ctx.config` are still empty.
- aec851d: `KINDGI_DEV` (development mode; boolean like `KINDGI_DOCS`) and the `dotenv` secrets backend: `KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND=dotenv` reads and writes `.env` files in `KINDGI_SECRETS_DOTENV_DIR` (required), optionally narrowed by `KINDGI_SECRETS_DOTENV_FILES` (default `.env,.env.local`). `EnvTarget.secretsBackend` accepts `dotenv`. The server allows the `dotenv` backend only in development mode.
- aec851d: Kindgi inside an existing app: project-local configuration, the app's own env files, nothing leaks.
  
  - **BREAKING — `@kindgi/env-schema`:** the runtime reads only `KINDGI_*` names. `DATABASE_URL` → `KINDGI_DATABASE_URL`, `OPENFGA_API_URL` → `KINDGI_OPENFGA_API_URL`, with no fallback; every unprefixed name belongs to the agents.
  - **`@kindgi/dotenv-file`:** parses the dotenv format the way applications do (verified against `dotenv@16.3.1`), adds `${VAR}` expansion (agrees with dotenv-expand 10 and 12 where they agree) and layered reading. The writer keeps hand-written lines byte for byte and refuses values it can't write back unchanged.
  - **`@kindgi/handler-runtime`:** `loadKindgiConfig` — one loader for `kindgi.config.*` (including `.mts` for CommonJS hosts) that reports a broken config's cause; `resolveDiscovery` walks only each discovery pattern's fixed prefix instead of the whole host repo.
  - **`@kindgi/secrets-dotenv`:** one resolver for a pack's env files (`.env` < `.env.local`, or `dev.envFiles`). `KINDGI_*` names never resolve as secrets, dev writes go only to `.env.local`, and warnings name `file:line`, never the line itself.
  - **`@kindgi/sdk`:** authoring skills updated (a handler with nothing to `await` can return `Promise.resolve`).
- aec851d: Public run tokens: a browser can follow a run's progress without a secret API token.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `CreateAppInput.publicRunTokens` (`signingKey` + `keyId`, an Ed25519 key; lifetimes; `allowedOrigins`). When set, `POST /v1/runs` returns `publicAccessToken` + `publicAccessTokenExpiresAt` (15 minutes by default), and `POST /v1/tokens/public` mints tokens for up to 50 runs (at most 24 hours).
    - Progress routes: `GET /v1/runs/{runId}/progress` (`RunProgress`: status and timing, no input, output or failure message) and `GET /v1/runs/{runId}/progress/stream` (`RunProgressEvent`: kind, node, sequence, time; no payload). They accept an API token or a public run token. `GET /v1/runs/{runId}` and `/stream` are unchanged and keep requiring an API token.
    - A public run token (`kgi_pt_…`, Ed25519-signed, stateless) is accepted only by the two progress routes (every other route answers 403), for the runs it names and their descendants (others answer 404).
    - The routes a public token may use come from the operation registry (`security: 'bearer-or-public-run'`); the OpenAPI document declares the `publicRunToken` security scheme on them.
    - CORS for `allowedOrigins` on the two progress routes only, ahead of authentication.
    - `mintPublicRunToken` / `verifyPublicRunToken` for deployments that issue tokens themselves.
  - `@kindgi/client`:
    - `subscribeToRun({ apiUrl, runId, accessToken, refreshAccessToken })`: follow a run's progress from a browser with a public token, refreshing it when it expires.
    - `runs.progress`, `runs.streamProgress`, `tokens.createPublic`.
    - `runs.stream` now follows the run to its terminal event: when the server ends the stream at its time limit, it reconnects from the last event instead of ending early. `followRun` is the shared loop; `readSse` takes `lastEventId` and per-attempt `headers`, and throws `SseHttpError` (with `status`) on HTTP errors.
  - `@kindgi/env-schema`: `KINDGI_PUBLIC_TOKEN_SIGNING_KEY_PATH` and `KINDGI_CORS_ORIGINS`.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: The hooks the runtime needs to guard the server's connections to hosts a tenant chose (T83). The guard itself is in the runtime.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:** `HostReach` gains `'metadata-network'` (link-local addresses, where the cloud metadata endpoints hand out the server's credentials) and `'loopback'` (the server's own host). `KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS=deployed` refuses both, as well as `'exec'`.
  - **`@kindgi/capabilities`:** `AdapterFactoryInput.fetch` is the fetch for a provider endpoint the registration chose.
  - **`@kindgi/adapter-model-openai-compat`:** the factory sends through that fetch.
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:**
    - `defineTool(spec, { synthesizer: { fetch } })` and `ToolSpecSynthesizerOptions`: a declarative HTTP tool's handler sends through the runtime's fetch.
    - `validateToolManifest` now refuses an HTTP tool whose `urlTemplate` puts a `{placeholder}` in the scheme, host or port, or isn't `http(s)://` with a host. Placeholders belong in the path and query, where they're URL-encoded; in the authority, a run's input would pick the host.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS`'s description says what `deployed` refuses.
- aec851d: Messages and variable descriptions no longer point at internal components: `KINDGI_API_PORT` / `KINDGI_OPENFGA_API_URL` / `KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND` descriptions say what the runtime does; the `external` guardrail strategy's error says to register an execution strategy; the payload-version error reads "Unsupported payload version N (this reader handles version M)" — it was worded "newer than this reader" also for older versions.
- aec851d: - `@kindgi/env-schema`: `KINDGI_DATABASE_URL`'s documented dev default is now `postgres://localhost:5432/kindgi`, matching the runtime's new default database name.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the `kindgi-getting-started`, `kindgi-authoring-mcp-servers` and `kindgi-framework-feedback` skills no longer list `sources:` paths outside this repository.
