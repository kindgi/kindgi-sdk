# @kindgi/env-schema

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: A deployment's tools and guardrails keep where their code is, and the trust list it's verified against gets routes.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`, `POST /v1/deployments`:**
    - **What registers is the signed image's index.** The server reads `/app/index.json` from the image, checks it hashes to the signed `indexHash`, and registers what it declares. The request body no longer carries `index`. Before, the route validated and registered the body's copy, which no signature covers, so a replayed request could register tools the image never shipped. The image's index must also name the signed `artifactVersion` (`400 image-unverifiable` otherwise).
    - **The code pointer.** A tool's `modulePath` and a guardrail's `checkModulePath` become `codeArtifactRef: { kind: 'oci', imageRef, modulePath, artifactVersion }`, pointing into the deployed image. Before, they were stripped, so a deployed pack tool had no code the runtime could reach.
    - **What a deployment shipped.** The record gains `contents`: each tool's, agent's and flow's `{ id, version }`, and each guardrail's `{ id }`. `DeploymentRegisterInput` and `Deployment` carry it; it's required, so a `DeploymentBinding` stores it. Versions are immutable and a digest deploys once, so the latest deployment is the live one. A rollback rolls forward: deploy the earlier code again under new versions.
    - **The catalog caches hear of it.** A new deployment calls `onToolWrite` / `onGuardrailWrite` for each tool and guardrail it registered, as `POST /v1/tools` and `POST /v1/guardrails` do, so a runtime's tool and guardrail bridges see it at once. `DeploymentContents` and `DeployedPrimitive` are exported.
    - **Indexed guardrails deploy.** A guardrail's `checkId` becomes its `check`, and the index-only `configSchema` is dropped, as `kindgi dev` maps them. Before, every guardrail the indexer writes failed validation.
  - **`@kindgi/api`, `/v1/signing-keys`:** the tenant's trusted signing keys, the public keys whose deployments verify. Mounted when `signingKeyRegistry` is passed, on its own, without the deployments route.
    - `POST /v1/signing-keys` trusts a key: `keyId`, `publicKey` (base64 Ed25519), `label?`. It returns `201`, or `200` for the same key again. A known id with another key is `409 signing-key-conflict`; rotate under a new id.
    - `GET /v1/signing-keys` lists the active keys (`?includeRevoked=true`, `?label=` prefix). `GET /v1/signing-keys/{keyId}` returns one key, revoked or not.
    - `POST /v1/signing-keys/{keyId}/revoke` takes an optional `reason`. A revoked key stays readable for audit and verifies no new deployments.
    - Writes need the `signing-keys:write` capability.
    - Revocation is final: trusting a revoked key id again is `409 signing-key-revoked`.
    - New error codes: `signing-key-conflict` (409), `signing-key-revoked` (409), `signing-key-algorithm-unsupported` (400), `signing-key-store-error` (500).
  - **`@kindgi/client`:** `client.signingKeys` (`trust`, `list`, `get`, `revoke`); `deployments.register` takes no `index`. The Python client's models and resources follow.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** the `image-registry` group, how the server reads deployment images: `KINDGI_IMAGE_REGISTRY_HOST`, `_USERNAME`, `_PASSWORD` (credentials for one host, all three or none) and `_INSECURE_HOSTS` (hosts reached over plain HTTP).
- aec851d: `KINDGI_DEV_HOST_ALIAS` (development only): where the server's outbound calls to a loopback address connect instead. Inside a container, loopback is the container itself, so webhooks to the app, HTTP MCP endpoints, a model provider and the pack service on the developer's machine would all miss. `kindgi dev` sets `host.docker.internal` on Docker Desktop. The URL, the `Host` header and the TLS server name stay as written; only the connection goes to the alias.
- aec851d: The server binary's development settings, so `kindgi dev` can run the runtime as a container:
  
  - `KINDGI_API_HOST` (core): the address the API server binds. Default: all interfaces. `127.0.0.1` keeps it off the network.
  - `KINDGI_PACK_DIR` (development only): the pack directory `kindgi dev` runs. The server reads the pack's primitives from the index `kindgi dev` writes there (`.kindgi/dev/index.json`) instead of from Postgres, and signed deployments are off.
  - `KINDGI_DEV_CONSOLE_LOGIN` (development only): the console logs in by itself through `GET /__dev/bearer`, which answers loopback hosts only.
  
  The development settings form a new `dev` group, listed last in `.env.example`. `KINDGI_DEV`'s description now names them.
- aec851d: `KINDGI_LICENSE_KEY`: the commercial license key (`kgi_lk_...`) the server checks offline at startup outside development mode. Without a valid key, a server that isn't in development mode refuses to start; `KINDGI_DEV=true` needs none. `LICENSE_KEY_VAR` names it.
- aec851d: `parseCorsOrigins`, `CORS_ORIGINS_VAR` and `PUBLIC_TOKEN_KEY_PATH_VAR`: the check for `KINDGI_CORS_ORIGINS` (exact origins: a scheme, a host and an optional port; no path or wildcard), so the server and the CLI refuse the same values with the same message.
- aec851d: A pack declares the process environment its code reads, and the pack service says what's missing.
  
  - **`kindgi.config`** takes `env: { required?, optional? }`: the names the pack's code reads from `process.env`. The indexer validates them (environment variable names, no `KINDGI_*`, no name twice) and writes them, sorted, into `index.json` as `env`, which is absent when nothing is declared. A malformed declaration fails indexing as `config-invalid`. `resolvePackEnv` and `missingPackEnv` are exported for tools that check the same thing.
  - **The pack service**, with a required name unset or empty, isn't ready: `/readyz` and every call answer 503 `{ "error": "missing env", "missingEnv": [...] }`, names only. `/v1/info` always lists `missingEnv`, and the names are logged once at startup (`missing-env`). `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_CHECK=warn` serves anyway; anything other than `strict` (the default) or `warn` fails startup.
  - **`@kindgi/specs`:** `pack-index.schema.json` 1.4.0 adds the optional `env`; `pack-protocol.schema.json` 2.2.0 adds the optional `missingEnv` to `info`. The Python SDK's vendored copies match.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_PACK_ENV_CHECK` (component `pack-service`).
  - **`@kindgi/pack-conformance`:** cases for the declared env, and `unsupported` on a target, which skips the cases for a part of the contract it hasn't implemented yet.
  - **The `kindgi-authoring-tools` skill** says to declare the names a tool reads.
- aec851d: The pack service's variables, and the server's for reaching it.
  
  - **The `component` axis.** `EnvTarget.component` is `server` (the default) or `pack-service`, the separate process that runs a pack's code. The server's vars don't apply to the pack service's target.
  - **The `packTransport` axis.** `EnvTarget.packTransport: 'http'` is set when the server calls a pack service at `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_URL`. Its token is then required.
  - **New vars,** in a new `pack-service` group:
    - `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_URL`: the server's address for the pack service. Unset, no pack code runs.
    - `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_TOKEN`: the secret shared by the server and the pack service. Required by the pack service, and by the server with an HTTP pack transport.
    - `KINDGI_PACK_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS`: how long one pack call may take (default 120000).
    - `KINDGI_PACK_INDEX` and `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_MAX_CONCURRENCY`: the pack service's index path (default `/app/index.json`) and call cap (default 32). The pack service already reads both; they're declared here now.
- aec851d: What a server on Cloud Run needs to reach its pack service and images, and to take its keys without files:
  
  - `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_AUTH`: `token` (default) | `google-id-token`, which also sends a Google ID token for an IAM-protected pack service.
  - `KINDGI_IMAGE_REGISTRY_AUTH`: `static` (default, the username and password) | `google`, the server's own Google identity for Artifact Registry.
  - `KINDGI_SECRETS_AAD_KEY` and `KINDGI_PUBLIC_TOKEN_SIGNING_KEY`: the key material itself, base64, as the alternative to the `_PATH` variables (one or the other, not both) for platforms that give secrets as environment variables. `KINDGI_SECRETS_AAD_KEY_PATH` is no longer required on its own: the postgres backend needs one of the two. `PUBLIC_TOKEN_KEY_VAR` names the new signing-key variable.
- aec851d: What a tenant registers can no longer reach the server's own host unless the deployment allows it, and MCP endpoints authenticate through the secrets store.
  
  - **`KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS`** (`@kindgi/env-schema`): `deployed` refuses a `stdio` MCP endpoint, a command the server would run in its container as its user. `local` allows it, for a machine where every token holder may run commands. Unset, it's `local` under `KINDGI_DEV` and `deployed` otherwise.
  - **`@kindgi/api`:**
    - `createApp` takes `tenantHostAccess` (default `deployed`). Under `deployed`, registering a `stdio` endpoint answers `403 host-access-denied`, a new error code.
    - `deniesHostReach`, `parseTenantHostAccess`, `TENANT_HOST_ACCESS_LEVELS` and `stdioRefusal` are exported for the runtime's connect-time check. Checks ask `deniesHostReach(level, reach)`, so a stricter level is one more row.
    - `mcpRouter` takes the level as a fourth argument.
  - **`MCPEndpoint.secretRef: { envName, name }` replaces `authRef`.** It's a secret by name in the deployment's store, resolved at the endpoint's tenant scope, the shape webhooks and providers use.
    - `env:NAME` references, which read the server's own environment, are gone.
    - The register body now refuses unknown fields, so an `authRef` is a `400` (`unknown-field`), not silently dropped.
    - The webhook routes and MCP share one `secretRef` parser.
  - **`@kindgi/client`:** `McpEndpoint` and `RegisterMcpEndpointInput` take `secretRef` (`McpEndpointSecretRef`). The Python `kindgi.client` is regenerated: `secret_ref` replaces `auth_ref`.
- aec851d: Tool secrets reach the tools that declare them.
  
  - `@kindgi/env-schema`: `KINDGI_ENV`, the env a runtime serves. Secrets a tool declares by name (`needsSpec.secrets`) resolve under it; development mode defaults it to `local`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries a declarative tool's `spec` (`defineTool({ spec })`) into `index.json`, so the runtime runs the tool itself and resolves its `secretRef`s, instead of the pack service running it without them.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `pack-index.schema.json` 1.2.0 adds a tool's optional `spec`. The Python SDK's vendored copy matches.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the `kindgi-python-authoring-tools` skill — and the Python SDK's README and `ToolContext.secrets` docstring — say how to declare a secret (`needs_spec={"secrets": …}`) and read it from `ctx.secrets`; `ctx.env` and `ctx.config` are still empty.
- aec851d: `KINDGI_DEV` (development mode; boolean like `KINDGI_DOCS`) and the `dotenv` secrets backend: `KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND=dotenv` reads and writes `.env` files in `KINDGI_SECRETS_DOTENV_DIR` (required), optionally narrowed by `KINDGI_SECRETS_DOTENV_FILES` (default `.env,.env.local`). `EnvTarget.secretsBackend` accepts `dotenv`. The server allows the `dotenv` backend only in development mode.
- aec851d: Kindgi inside an existing app: project-local configuration, the app's own env files, nothing leaks.
  
  - **BREAKING — `@kindgi/env-schema`:** the runtime reads only `KINDGI_*` names. `DATABASE_URL` → `KINDGI_DATABASE_URL`, `OPENFGA_API_URL` → `KINDGI_OPENFGA_API_URL`, with no fallback; every unprefixed name belongs to the agents.
  - **`@kindgi/dotenv-file`:** parses the dotenv format the way applications do (verified against `dotenv@16.3.1`), adds `${VAR}` expansion (agrees with dotenv-expand 10 and 12 where they agree) and layered reading. The writer keeps hand-written lines byte for byte and refuses values it can't write back unchanged.
  - **`@kindgi/handler-runtime`:** `loadKindgiConfig` — one loader for `kindgi.config.*` (including `.mts` for CommonJS hosts) that reports a broken config's cause; `resolveDiscovery` walks only each discovery pattern's fixed prefix instead of the whole host repo.
  - **`@kindgi/secrets-dotenv`:** one resolver for a pack's env files (`.env` < `.env.local`, or `dev.envFiles`). `KINDGI_*` names never resolve as secrets, dev writes go only to `.env.local`, and warnings name `file:line`, never the line itself.
  - **`@kindgi/sdk`:** authoring skills updated (a handler with nothing to `await` can return `Promise.resolve`).
- aec851d: Public run tokens: a browser can follow a run's progress without a secret API token.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `CreateAppInput.publicRunTokens` (`signingKey` + `keyId`, an Ed25519 key; lifetimes; `allowedOrigins`). When set, `POST /v1/runs` returns `publicAccessToken` + `publicAccessTokenExpiresAt` (15 minutes by default), and `POST /v1/tokens/public` mints tokens for up to 50 runs (at most 24 hours).
    - Progress routes: `GET /v1/runs/{runId}/progress` (`RunProgress`: status and timing, no input, output or failure message) and `GET /v1/runs/{runId}/progress/stream` (`RunProgressEvent`: kind, node, sequence, time; no payload). They accept an API token or a public run token. `GET /v1/runs/{runId}` and `/stream` are unchanged and keep requiring an API token.
    - A public run token (`kgi_pt_…`, Ed25519-signed, stateless) is accepted only by the two progress routes (every other route answers 403), for the runs it names and their descendants (others answer 404).
    - The routes a public token may use come from the operation registry (`security: 'bearer-or-public-run'`); the OpenAPI document declares the `publicRunToken` security scheme on them.
    - CORS for `allowedOrigins` on the two progress routes only, ahead of authentication.
    - `mintPublicRunToken` / `verifyPublicRunToken` for deployments that issue tokens themselves.
  - `@kindgi/client`:
    - `subscribeToRun({ apiUrl, runId, accessToken, refreshAccessToken })`: follow a run's progress from a browser with a public token, refreshing it when it expires.
    - `runs.progress`, `runs.streamProgress`, `tokens.createPublic`.
    - `runs.stream` now follows the run to its terminal event: when the server ends the stream at its time limit, it reconnects from the last event instead of ending early. `followRun` is the shared loop; `readSse` takes `lastEventId` and per-attempt `headers`, and throws `SseHttpError` (with `status`) on HTTP errors.
  - `@kindgi/env-schema`: `KINDGI_PUBLIC_TOKEN_SIGNING_KEY_PATH` and `KINDGI_CORS_ORIGINS`.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: The hooks the runtime needs to guard the server's connections to hosts a tenant chose (T83). The guard itself is in the runtime.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:** `HostReach` gains `'metadata-network'` (link-local addresses, where the cloud metadata endpoints hand out the server's credentials) and `'loopback'` (the server's own host). `KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS=deployed` refuses both, as well as `'exec'`.
  - **`@kindgi/capabilities`:** `AdapterFactoryInput.fetch` is the fetch for a provider endpoint the registration chose.
  - **`@kindgi/adapter-model-openai-compat`:** the factory sends through that fetch.
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:**
    - `defineTool(spec, { synthesizer: { fetch } })` and `ToolSpecSynthesizerOptions`: a declarative HTTP tool's handler sends through the runtime's fetch.
    - `validateToolManifest` now refuses an HTTP tool whose `urlTemplate` puts a `{placeholder}` in the scheme, host or port, or isn't `http(s)://` with a host. Placeholders belong in the path and query, where they're URL-encoded; in the authority, a run's input would pick the host.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS`'s description says what `deployed` refuses.
- aec851d: Messages and variable descriptions no longer point at internal components: `KINDGI_API_PORT` / `KINDGI_OPENFGA_API_URL` / `KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND` descriptions say what the runtime does; the `external` guardrail strategy's error says to register an execution strategy; the payload-version error reads "Unsupported payload version N (this reader handles version M)" — it was worded "newer than this reader" also for older versions.
- aec851d: - `@kindgi/env-schema`: `KINDGI_DATABASE_URL`'s documented dev default is now `postgres://localhost:5432/kindgi`, matching the runtime's new default database name.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the `kindgi-getting-started`, `kindgi-authoring-mcp-servers` and `kindgi-framework-feedback` skills no longer list `sources:` paths outside this repository.
