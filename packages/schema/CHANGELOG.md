## 0.1.5-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- e27d050: Improvement passes. `POST /v1/proposals/improve` starts one: the runtime looks for better values for an agent version's tunable settings on a test set, within a budget (default $5 and 30 candidates). It writes its best candidate as an improvement proposal, which waits for a reviewer when requested.
  - `GET /v1/improvement-passes` and `/{passId}` read passes back: their status, the candidates compared, the cost, and once one ends, its outcome (`proposed` with the proposal, or `nothing-found` with the hold-out numbers).
  - `POST /v1/improvement-passes/{passId}/cancel` stops a pass.
  - Without improvement passes in the runtime, these answer `501 improve-unsupported`.
  - The TypeScript client has `proposals.improve` and `improvementPasses.{list,get,cancel}`. The Python client has `proposals.improve` and `improvement_passes`.
  
  A settings block's schema marks the keys a pass may tune with `"x-kindgi-tunable": true`: a number or integer with a minimum below its maximum, or an enum. Any other mark is refused at publish, and `tunableKeys(schema)` lists the marked keys.
  
  Comparisons can run unpublished settings values (`overrides.settings`, checked against the blocks the version pins) and part of the test set (`sample: { part, seed, holdOutShare }`, a deterministic search/hold-out split). A promotion gate fails a comparison with overrides (`sameContents`) and one on the search part (`comparison.sample`). A proposal's evaluate takes `sample`.
  
  A replayed tool that reads from nowhere, re-run because the compared version pins other settings, is marked `recomputed: true` and doesn't count as divergence.
  
  A proposal that a drafter wrote (not a person) waits for a reviewer when requested, even where the scope's policy asks for no approval.

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- 89a14b6: Tools from MCP servers built with the TypeScript MCP SDK are no longer skipped. Their schemas declare JSON Schema draft-07 (`"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"`), and every tool schema compiled as Draft 2020-12 only, so each one failed with `no schema with key or ref "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"`. An MCP tool's schemas (`transport: 'mcp'`) now compile in the dialect they declare: draft-06, draft-07, 2019-09 or 2020-12 (the default when they declare none), each with its own semantics (a draft-07 array-form `items` is a tuple), and without Ajv's strict mode, a lint for the schemas a pack writes: a server's union `type`s, open tuples and extension keywords are valid JSON Schema. Another dialect is refused, naming it. A pack's own tools are unchanged: Draft 2020-12, in strict mode; one declaring another dialect is refused with a message that says so. `@kindgi/schema` exports the compiler as `compileJsonSchema` (with `dialects` and `strict` options), and `jsonSchemaDialect`. `tool.schema.json`'s `input` and `output` descriptions say which dialects a tool's schemas may be in.

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: Tool inputs get their Zod defaults, transforms and refinements.
  
  - `@kindgi/schema`:
    - `toJSONSchema(schema, io)` and `toJSONSchemaSync(schema, converter, io)` take a required `io` (`SchemaIo`, `'input'` or `'output'`). The two sides differ exactly where Zod defaults: on the input side a `.default()` field is optional, on the output side it is required. Before, every conversion produced the output side.
    - `parseWithSchema(schema, value)` parses through a Zod schema's Standard Schema interface: defaults, transforms and refinements applied, or the issues.
  - `@kindgi/tools`:
    - A tool's advertised input schema is the input side, so a model may leave a defaulted field out.
    - `invokeTool` validates a copy of the input, filling in JSON Schema `default`s. A Zod-authored tool's input is then parsed with `inputZod`, so the handler gets its parsed input. A failed refinement is `input-validation-failed`, with the field's path.
    - A handler's input type defaults to `InferOutput` of the input schema, the parsed type.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: `runWorker`, which the pack service runs tools through, prepares the input the same way. The indexer converts tool inputs and guardrail config on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: a check's config schema converts on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: a typed agent's output schema converts on the output side, so downstream steps can rely on every field.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the tools skill explains what a handler receives.
