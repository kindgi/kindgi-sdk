### Patch Changes

- fdb86ae: An approval and the run waiting on it end together.
  - **A reviewer's withdraw ends the run:** on a gate approval it cancels the run's waitpoint, and the turn fails with `hitl-withdrawn` ("The approval for … was withdrawn"), right away instead of at the approval's deadline. Every `hitl-*` failure is a person's outcome, not an error.
  - **A run's end withdraws its open approvals:** they show `withdrawnBecause` (`run-cancelled` or `run-ended`).
  - **A decision on an approval whose run has ended is refused before anything is recorded:** `409 run-already-terminal`, with the ended run's `runId` and `status` in `details`. A decision recorded just before the run ended stands: the answer has `waitpointResolved: false` and the run's `runStatus`.
  - **Approvals carry `requestedBy`, `separateApprover`, `escalatedFrom` and `escalatedTo`.** `identity.whoami` returns the caller's `actor` in the same form as `requestedBy`.
  - **The approvals list takes `runId`, and `includeDescendants`** for the runs inside it.
- a2b2ae8: **Examples name current models.** The Java and Scala agent-authoring skills' `preferredModel` and `models.allow` examples use `claude-haiku-5-5` instead of `claude-haiku-4-5`, which Anthropic retires on or after 2026-10-15. The `preferredProvider`, `preferredModel` and `ModelInfo.name` docs give `anthropic` and `claude-sonnet-5-5` as their examples.
- 307771f: Guardrail outcomes: what each guardrail's checks came to, passes included, counted on the server.
  
  - **The record:** an agent turn's guardrail gate records each check as `passed`, `violated` (the answer went through), `blocked` (a `halt` failed the turn) or `errored` (the check couldn't run). It records through `InvokeAgentBindings.guardrailOutcomes`, a `GuardrailOutcomeSink` from `@kindgi/guardrails`, before it acts on them, so a blocked turn is recorded too.
    - **No content:** only ids, the action, the severity and an error's code. No answer, and no check's reason.
    - **Not recorded:** replays and dry runs.
    - **Strict:** a sink that throws fails the step with `persistence-error`, so the counts never silently miss a turn.
    - **Without a sink,** nothing is recorded.
  - **`categorizeOutcomes`** also answers `checks`, each guardrail's outcome in order.
  - **`GET /v1/guardrails/{guardrailId}/outcomes`:** a guardrail's outcomes on a project's agent turns over a window. The answer has the `counts`, the same counts per agent version (`byAgentVersion`), the window's latest blocked turns (`recentBlocked`, run ids and times only) and `recordedSince`, the earliest outcome kept.
    - **The query:** `projectId`, `from` and `to` are required, with a window of at most 90 days. `recent` is optional: 0 to 50, 10 by default.
    - **Who:** it needs `read` on the guardrail and on the project.
    - **Retention:** outcomes go with their run's retention, so a window can hold fewer than asked.
  - **`GuardrailRegistryBinding.outcomes`** is optional. Without it, the route answers `501 guardrail-outcomes-not-supported`.
  - **The clients:** TypeScript `guardrails.outcomes(id, query)`; Python `guardrails.outcomes(...)`.
- 8b60576: **A tool call's idempotency key.** A run's step can run more than once: resumed after an approval, retried after a failure, or run again when the runtime restarted while it ran. So a tool that changes something (a refund, an email, a payment) could do it twice, with no key to dedupe on. `ToolContext.idempotencyKey` is the same every time the same call runs, and different for every other call: pass it to the system you write to (an `Idempotency-Key` header, a client reference, a unique column), or look for it there first.
  
  - **What it is:** a version 5 UUID (RFC 9562) under a fixed namespace (`TOOL_IDEMPOTENCY_NAMESPACE`), over the run, the step and the tool, plus the model's call id for a call a model asked for (`toolIdempotencyKey`, `@kindgi/tools`). The pack protocol schema says how, so any runtime makes the same key.
  - **The step:** `NodeContext.stepScope` names a step the same every time it runs (its node, a loop body's step with its iteration, a fanout branch). A model's call id alone isn't enough: it's only unique within one of its answers, so two turns of a loop can share one.
  - **Every pack language:** the pack protocol's call context carries it (protocol 2.6.0; an older pack service ignores it). Python `ctx.idempotency_key`, Java and Scala `ctx.idempotencyKey()`. The conformance suite checks that each pack service hands it to the tool, and that a 0.1.1 service still answers a call carrying it.
  - **Absent** outside a run, and from a runtime that can't name its steps (before 0.1.6): the call can't be deduped on it then.
  - **The docs:** "Make a side effect happen once" in Write a tool, and the tools skills (every language). `requestId` is no longer described as an idempotency key.
- bbdccbb: An agent turn stops when its run is stopped. The runtime aborts a step's `abortSignal` when its run ends from outside: a cancel, or a shutdown that interrupts the runs it was executing. A turn's own work (its model call, its tool calls) listened only to the turn's abort, so a call in flight ran on until it answered.
  
  - **Now:** each step of a turn links the step's `abortSignal` to the turn's, so a call in flight is aborted at once, and the turn ends as aborted from outside (`agent-turn-aborted`, reason `external`).
  - **A wall-clock timeout keeps its own reason** (`timeout`).
  - **A cancelled turn's message stays plain:** `Agent turn cancelled`. The failure of the step its cancel aborted only restates the cancel, and is no longer appended as the turn's serialized failure. Any other words are kept.
  - **No API change.**
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`** lists `KINDGI_RUN_ENDED_CHECK_MS`: how often a server stops the runs it executes that were ended from outside, so a step that writes nothing for a while, such as a long model call, stops within this time of a cancel. Default 5000 ms; at least 1000.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 71ec431: `same-user` memory is the run's end user's, never the user a key acts for. A run with no `participantId` used to read and keep same-user memory as the user its credential acts for. An admin's key or an app's service account that starts runs for many customers is one user for all of them, so one customer's turn could recall another's conversations and facts.
  
  - **Reads:** a `same-user` retrieval, of facts or of conversations, in a run that names no end user reads nothing. The turn records why (`degraded: no-participant`).
  - **Writes:** the built-in `kindgi_remember` with `same-user` isn't offered in such a run, and `rememberTarget` refuses it.
  - **The warning:** the run's result carries a `memory-needs-participant` warning that says to pass the person's `participantId` on each run.
  - **With a `participantId`:** same-user memory is that end user's only. Facts kept for the user the run acts for are no longer read as anyone's. Before this change, `remember` kept a fact for the run's user whenever no end user was named, so a service account that served many customers may hold their facts, mixed, under its user. Reading those for every named customer would leak them again.
  - **Other scopes:** tenant-, project- and conversation-scoped memory is unaffected.
- a432049: A halting guardrail whose check can't run now stops the turn; it used to let it through. A guardrail whose check isn't registered, has an invalid configuration, or whose judge can't be routed to a model (or with no check registry bound at all) no longer passes silently. A check that throws (pack code that crashed, a pack service that couldn't be reached, a judge call that failed) is one of these too: a `check-failed` evaluation error with what it threw, where it used to fail the turn whatever the guardrail's action; a cancelled turn still ends as it did. With `halt`, the turn fails with `guardrail-violation`: `violations` is empty, and `evaluationErrors` names the guardrail, the error code and why. With any other action, the turn goes on. In both cases every such error emits a `guardrail.error` turn event, adds the guardrail's provenance node (`evaluated: false`), and is listed under `errors` in the `evaluate-guardrails` step's output. `categorizeOutcomes` takes the guardrails the outcomes came from, so each error carries its guardrail's action and severity (`blockingErrors` holds the `halt` ones), and `describeBlockingViolations` names guardrails that couldn't run.
- e27d050: Improvement passes. `POST /v1/proposals/improve` starts one: the runtime looks for better values for an agent version's tunable settings on a test set, within a budget (default $5 and 30 candidates). It writes its best candidate as an improvement proposal, which waits for a reviewer when requested.
  - `GET /v1/improvement-passes` and `/{passId}` read passes back: their status, the candidates compared, the cost, and once one ends, its outcome (`proposed` with the proposal, or `nothing-found` with the hold-out numbers).
  - `POST /v1/improvement-passes/{passId}/cancel` stops a pass.
  - Without improvement passes in the runtime, these answer `501 improve-unsupported`.
  - The TypeScript client has `proposals.improve` and `improvementPasses.{list,get,cancel}`. The Python client has `proposals.improve` and `improvement_passes`.
  
  A settings block's schema marks the keys a pass may tune with `"x-kindgi-tunable": true`: a number or integer with a minimum below its maximum, or an enum. Any other mark is refused at publish, and `tunableKeys(schema)` lists the marked keys.
  
  Comparisons can run unpublished settings values (`overrides.settings`, checked against the blocks the version pins) and part of the test set (`sample: { part, seed, holdOutShare }`, a deterministic search/hold-out split). A promotion gate fails a comparison with overrides (`sameContents`) and one on the search part (`comparison.sample`). A proposal's evaluate takes `sample`.
  
  A replayed tool that reads from nowhere, re-run because the compared version pins other settings, is marked `recomputed: true` and doesn't count as divergence.
  
  A proposal that a drafter wrote (not a person) waits for a reviewer when requested, even where the scope's policy asks for no approval.
- 1633db1: Memory facts keep their id across revisions, and every read sees only what the caller may.
  
  - **The scope guard.** A memory read gets `readers` (`MemoryReaders`): the projects, orgs, user, end user (`participantId`, new on `MemoryScope`) and conversations it may see. A binding applies them inside its query, before any limit; `isReadableBy` is the rule. On `/v1/memory`, the route works out the readers from the caller: a tenant admin reads everything; anyone else reads tenant-wide facts, the projects and orgs they may read, their own user facts, and every end user's and conversation's facts in the projects they may write. Writes are checked against the scope (`403 permission-denied`). An agent turn's retrievals see the run's project and org, the user it acts for, its conversation and that conversation's end user, never another conversation's or another end user's; `same-project` in a run without a project selects nothing.
  - **Revisions.** `POST /v1/memory/facts/{factId}/supersede` writes the fact's next revision (same id, body `{ content, expectVersion?, … }`) and returns it; `DELETE /v1/memory/facts/{factId}` closes the current one; `POST …/verify` marks it verified; `GET …/revisions` lists them; `?version=` and `?asOf=` read the past. `409 fact-changed` (with `expectVersion`) and `409 legal-hold` refuse; a runtime without delete, verify or history answers `501 memory-operation-unsupported`.
  - **Facts** carry `revisionId`, `trust`, `verifiedBy`/`verifiedAt`, `attributedTo` (from the writer), `generatedBy`, `subjects`, `validFrom`/`validUntil`/`observedAt`, `invalidatedAt`/`invalidatedBy`/`invalidationReason` and `review`, all optional.
  - `AuthzCheckBinding.listObjects` (optional) lists the objects a principal may act on.
  - `POST /v1/runs` hands the run handler the caller (`InvokeAgentBindingInput.principal`, `InvokeFlowBindingInput.principal`), so a turn knows whom it acts for: their own user facts are among what it may read.
  - Clients: `memory.facts.supersede`, `.delete` (now `DELETE`, returning the closed revision), `.verify`, `.revisions`, and `version`/`asOf` on `read`/`list`. CLI: `kindgi memory facts supersede|delete|verify|revisions`, `--revision` and `--as-of` on `get`, `--as-of` on `list`.
- b67c599: Agents recall earlier conversations, and a conversation can be unregistered.
  
  - **Recall.** A retrieval intent with `source: 'conversations'` recalls messages of this agent's earlier conversations (a user's message or an agent's answer; tool calls are not indexed). It has no `types`, and its scopes are:
    - `same-user` (the usual choice): this end user's, or this user's, other conversations;
    - `same-conversation`: this conversation's messages older than the history window (`conversationPolicy.historyLimit`);
    - `same-segment`: conversations in the run's segment path (the same customer);
    - `same-project`: the project's conversations.
  
    `mode` works as for facts: absent (newest first), `keyword`, `semantic` (needs embeddings, else `semantic-unavailable`) or `both` (fused by rank).
  - **The people's own words, by default.** Recall returns users' messages only. `roles: ['user', 'agent']` adds the agent's earlier answers, which can carry its mistakes: they are quoted with `note: "earlier answer by the agent, not verified"`, and publishing warns `recall-agent-answers` (once per agent). Neighbouring messages follow the same roles.
  - **Other people's conversations.** `same-segment` and `same-project` recall them, in the run's own project only. Publishing such an agent warns `recall-other-people`, and in the prompt each of their messages is marked `anotherPerson`, without saying whose. Recall is always this agent's conversations, within what the run may recall (`isRecallReadableBy` in `@kindgi/memory`: a conversation is always someone's).
  - **The prompt.** Recalled messages are quoted in the `<memory>` block after the facts: the date, the message, and the messages either side. They are earlier conversation, never turns. The system message's memory line now names quotes from earlier conversations. **This changes what models see.**
  - **The turn.** `AgentTurnResult.recalled` (optional) and the journal keep what was recalled, with each message's ranks. A replay can reuse the past run's (`ReplayBinding.recalled`). The run's provenance has a `retrieval` node per recalled message (`source: conversations`), `retrieved-from` its intent's `search_memory` node.
  - **The binding contract** (additive: each new method and field is optional):
    - `MemoryQueryBinding.searchConversations?` (`SearchConversationsInput`, `RecallHit`, `RecalledMessage`). Without it, such an intent recalls nothing, and the journal says so (`degraded: no-recall`). Publishing warns `recall-unavailable` (`MemoryBinding.conversationRecall`).
    - `AppendMessageInput.recall` (the turn's user and segments, for the index).
    - `ReadMessagesInput.beforeSequence`/`last`: a turn now reads only its history window.
  - **Unregister.** `POST /v1/conversations/{id}/unregister` tombstones a conversation (`Conversation.unregisteredAt`). From then on no read, list or recall returns it, and it takes no more turns. The retention sweep removes it after the tenant's grace. `ConversationBinding.unregisterConversation?` (501 `conversation-unregister-unsupported` without it). The TS client has `conversations.unregister`, and so do the Python client and `kindgi conversations unregister`. `deleteConversation` is deprecated: it left a conversation's messages behind. It is optional now, and the next release drops it.
  - **Specs.** The agent spec (schema-version 1.6.0) has `source` and `same-segment`: an intent over facts needs `types`, one over conversations has none.
- 93ebe85: Agents can remember, under rules the model can't change.
  
  - **The declaration.** `defineAgent({ memory: { remember: { types: ['preference'], scope: 'same-user', keepDays: 30 } } })` gives the agent's turns the built-in tool `kindgi_remember`. The model picks the type (one of `types`), the text (up to 2,000 characters), an optional slot `key` and when it stops being true. It never picks the scope: `same-user` (the conversation's end user, else the user the run acts for), `same-conversation`, `same-project` or `tenant` come from the declaration and the run. Built-in tools are `kindgi_<verb>`, with no dots, so the model calls exactly the name the docs and instructions use, and the tool's description names it. The prefix is reserved: an agent can't list a built-in in `tools`, and publishing a tool whose id starts with `kindgi_` is refused (`BUILT_IN_TOOL_PREFIX` in `@kindgi/tools`).
  - **Every remembered fact** is `unverified`, attributed to the agent version (`attributedTo`) and to the run, step and tool call that wrote it (`generatedBy`). It expires after `keepDays` (default 30) unless a person verifies it. A new value for the same type and `key` replaces the one the same agent remembered before, as that fact's next revision. An agent never replaces another agent's fact or a person's.
  - **A person approves it first** when the scope is wider than one person (`same-project`, `tenant`), or the text reads like an instruction (always/never, ignore/disregard, "you must", a link, one of the agent's tools). Until then no read sees it, and the model is told it waits for review. Otherwise it's used at once.
  - **The tool dispatches like any other.** The agent's `hitl.tools` policy applies to it, a replay refuses it or uses the recording, and the tool error policy decides what a failed store does. `InvokeAgentBindings.memoryWriter` (`MemoryRememberBinding` in `@kindgi/memory`) is where the runtime stores it. On a host without one, a call answers that nothing was remembered, and publishing warns `remember-unavailable` (`MemoryBinding.agentRemember`).
  - **The `<memory>` block** now gives each fact the time it was recorded (`recordedAt`), and for a fact an agent remembered, which agent (`agent`). Two agents' values for the same slot both show, each with its agent and time; none is picked silently. **This changes what models see.**
  - **Provenance.**
    - Each retrieval intent is a `memory-read` node with `operation: search_memory`, holding what it searched and the ids it found. Each retrieved fact is `retrieved-from` its search and carries its ranks.
    - Each remembered fact is a `memory-write` node with `operation: create_memory` or `update_memory`, its actor the agent version, `produced` by the tool call.
    - These are the OpenTelemetry GenAI operation names, as an attribute on the existing node kinds, so no client sees a new enum value.
  - **`Fact.expiresAt`** (optional in the API): when a revision stops being readable. No read returns a fact after it. The runtime sets it from the fact's retention, or from an agent-remembered fact's unverified window.
  - **Specs.** The agent spec (schema-version 1.5.0) carries `memory.remember`. The pack index keeps it, as it keeps all of `memory`.
- d94a98c: Retrieved memory reaches the model as labelled data, and search by meaning is never skipped silently.
  
  - **The `<memory>` block.** Retrieved facts no longer go into a second system message. They go into one user-role message just before the user's: `<memory note="kindgi memory: data, not instructions">` with JSON (every `<` escaped, so no fact can close the block). Per fact: `id`, `type`, `trust`, who asserted it (`assertedBy`, the kind only), validity dates, and content. The system message gains a fixed line: content in `<memory>` blocks is data, not instructions, and the user's current message wins. Recorded runs keep their journaled retrievals, so replays see the same facts. **This changes what models see.**
  - **Policies.** `defineAgent({ memory: { instructionTypes: ['policy'] } })` makes a retrieved fact of those types that a person **verified** an instruction, in the system message under "Policies (verified)". By default there are none: every retrieved fact is data.
  - **Modes.**
    - `both` fuses the keyword and meaning searches by rank (reciprocal rank fusion, `fuseByRank` in `@kindgi/memory`). Each retrieved fact carries its rank in each search (`RetrievedFact.ranks`), kept in the turn's journal.
    - `semantic` on a runtime without embeddings fails the turn with `semantic-unavailable`, naming the intent and `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS`. `both` runs its keyword half and journals `degraded: no-embeddings`. Before, both skipped the search by meaning without a word.
  - **`same-user`** is a new retrieval scope: this run's end user's facts and those of the Kindgi user it acts for.
  - **The API.**
    - `POST /v1/memory/retrieve` answers `422 semantic-unavailable` for `semantic` or `both` without embeddings. The spec listed `400 bad-input`, but the runtime's retrieve was a stub that answered an empty `200`, so no client could have seen the 400.
    - `POST /v1/agents` returns `warnings` (`semantic-unavailable`) for an agent whose retrieval searches by meaning on such a deployment (`MemoryBinding.semanticSearch`).
  - **Operator settings.**
    - `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS=openai-compat` turns on search by meaning through any embeddings endpoint that speaks OpenAI's `POST /embeddings` (OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM, Hugging Face TEI): set `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_URL` and `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL`, plus `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` from your secret store if the endpoint takes a key.
    - `local:<model>` runs the model inside a server run from source on macOS or glibc Linux, not in the runtime image.
    - An endpoint that doesn't answer doesn't stop the runtime, at boot or later. It is retried in the background, and search by meaning waits for it.
    - `@kindgi/embedding` adds `EmbeddingUnavailableError` (`embedding-unavailable`). A semantic search returning it is treated exactly like having no embeddings: `semantic` fails the turn with `semantic-unavailable`, and `both` runs its keyword half and journals it.
    - `@kindgi/adapter-model-openai-compat` adds `createOpenAICompatEmbeddingProvider`. Its `probe()` embeds once, to learn the dimensions.
  - **Specs and SDKs.**
    - The agent spec (schema-version 1.4.0) and pack index carry `memory` and the `same-user` scope; both indexers, TS and Python (`Agent(memory=...)`), keep them.
    - CLI: `kindgi memory facts retrieve --query=<json>` is wired.
- fa77071: Paging `GET /v1/conversations`, `GET /v1/approvals` and `GET /v1/runs` no longer skips rows created in the same millisecond as the last row of a page. Postgres keeps timestamps to the microsecond, and the next cursor carried the last row's time through a JavaScript `Date`, which keeps milliseconds. So rows created earlier in that millisecond were left out of every following page; approvals also had no tie-breaker, so ones created at the same instant were skipped too. The next cursor now carries the last row's position exactly, with its id; a cursor a client already holds still answers as before. Bindings: `ConversationPage.next` (the exact position of a page's last conversation) and, for approvals, `ListApprovalsBindingInput.after` with `ListApprovalsBindingResult.exactCreatedAt`; all optional, and the routes fall back to the old cursor for a binding that doesn't give them. A cursor whose time isn't a time is now a 400 on conversations and runs, as it already was on approvals.
- b67c599: Improvement passes can draft prompt templates. `POST /v1/proposals/improve` takes `tiers: ['prompt']` with `model` (the tenant's provider and model that drafts the templates) and `candidates` (1–5, default 3). The agent version must take its instructions from a prompt block it pins.
  - Every pass takes `classWeights`, default `restricted-only`: a pass learns from trusted judgments only.
  - `checkDraftedTemplate` (`@kindgi/agents`) checks a drafted template against what the agent has. It must parse as Liquid and may read only the declared parameters, the current template's variables, the turn's clock and identity, and the settings blocks the version pins. It may not name a dotted id the agent doesn't use, and it may be at most twice as long as the current template (at least 2,000 characters).
  - Comparisons take `overrides.prompts`: a template for a prompt block the version pins, checked at start. The summary's candidate names the overridden prompt blocks, and a promotion gate fails such a comparison (`sameContents`).
  - The replay binding's `settings` is now `overrides` (`settings` and `prompts`).
  - A judged test set's reasons name their judgment's class (`judgeClassId`) and say whether it was recorded while the class was restricted (`restricted: true`).
  - A pass's `comparisons` show a refused template's issues (`refused: [{path, message}]`) and each drafted template's `hypothesis`. A proposal a pass drafted names the pass (`drafter.passId`).
- 81f46aa: **A replay sends a read-only tool the env values the past run's call saw.** A comparison that replays a run (a candidate agent version over a test set) runs some read-only tools live. Those tools now read the config the past run read, not today's, so an env value changed since then can't skew the judged deltas.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:** a judged run's copy keeps `context.toolEnv`, each tool's recorded env values by tool id. It's taken from an agent turn's calls and from a flow's tool steps, agent steps and sub-flows. It's optional in the spec, and a run from before env was recorded has none.
  - **`@kindgi/agents`:** a replay binding's `live` decision can carry `env`. The turn journals it with the decision, keeps it out of the replay report, and sends it as the call's `ctx.env`. Names it doesn't hold (a tool version that declares more) resolve as usual.
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:** `toolCallRecordKey` and `TOOL_ENV_RECORD_KEY` name where a call's `ToolContext.record` decisions are journaled, so dispatch sites and capture agree.
- d25c1b3: A run can be started at most once per idempotency key, and a run records the trigger that started it. Both are additive contracts, which a runtime implements.
  
  - **`idempotencyKey`** on `RunFlowInput`, `StartRunParams`, the run handler's `invokeFlow` / `invokeAgent` inputs and `InvokeAgentInput`. A start with a key that a run of the tenant already has starts nothing and answers that run. `startRun` and the run handler say so with `existing: true`. A trigger's fire uses `fire:<fireId>`, so a re-driven fire never runs twice.
  - **`trigger`** (`RunTriggerRef`: `triggerId`, `kind` `schedule` | `event` | `webhook`, `fireId`, `scheduledFor?`) on a run started by a trigger: on `KernelRunRecord`, and on the wire as `Run.trigger` (OpenAPI `RunTrigger`).
  - **`GET /v1/runs?triggerId=`** lists the runs a trigger started: `runs.list({ triggerId })` in TypeScript, `triggerId` on `ListRunsInput`, and `kindgi runs list --trigger=<id>`.
- 280377e: **A tool's env values, per project (`ctx.env`).** A tool that declares names in `needsSpec.env` gets their values in `ctx.env` on each call: the call's project's value, else its org's, else the tenant's, in the env the runtime serves (`KINDGI_ENV`). A schema `default` makes a name optional. The values a call used are recorded with it (`ToolContext.record`, new: the step's durable record, set by the dispatch site), so the call re-run after a wait or a retry sees the same ones. A runtime that resolves them is needed; with an older one, `ctx.env` stays absent.
  
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:** `ToolContext.env`; `ToolContext.record`, which an agent turn's tool dispatch (`@kindgi/agents`) sets to its step's record under `tool-call:<call id>:<tool id>:<key>`; and `TypedNeeds` documents what `env` and `secrets` take (strings, checked by their schema; `config` is reserved).
  - **Pack protocol 2.5.0** (`@kindgi/specs`, `@kindgi/handler-runtime`, the Python SDK): `callContext.env` holds the declared names' string values. It's additive: a pack service that predates it already passes it through.
  - **`kindgi env set/list/unset --scope=tenant|org:<id>|project:<id> --env=<name>`** act on the runtime's env values (`/v1/env`). Without `--scope` they edit the pack's local env files, as before. `--env` is required with `--scope`. `set` refuses to change a value without `--force`, and warns about a name that looks like a credential. A runtime that doesn't serve `/v1/env` gets a plain message.
  - `kindgi env`'s description now says what it manages. It used to say values "resolve into `needs.env` at deploy time", which nothing did.

## 0.1.5-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- a432049: A halting guardrail whose check can't run now stops the turn; it used to let it through. A guardrail whose check isn't registered, has an invalid configuration, or whose judge can't be routed to a model (or with no check registry bound at all) no longer passes silently. A check that throws (pack code that crashed, a pack service that couldn't be reached, a judge call that failed) is one of these too: a `check-failed` evaluation error with what it threw, where it used to fail the turn whatever the guardrail's action; a cancelled turn still ends as it did. With `halt`, the turn fails with `guardrail-violation`: `violations` is empty, and `evaluationErrors` names the guardrail, the error code and why. With any other action, the turn goes on. In both cases every such error emits a `guardrail.error` turn event, adds the guardrail's provenance node (`evaluated: false`), and is listed under `errors` in the `evaluate-guardrails` step's output. `categorizeOutcomes` takes the guardrails the outcomes came from, so each error carries its guardrail's action and severity (`blockingErrors` holds the `halt` ones), and `describeBlockingViolations` names guardrails that couldn't run.
- e27d050: Improvement passes. `POST /v1/proposals/improve` starts one: the runtime looks for better values for an agent version's tunable settings on a test set, within a budget (default $5 and 30 candidates). It writes its best candidate as an improvement proposal, which waits for a reviewer when requested.
  - `GET /v1/improvement-passes` and `/{passId}` read passes back: their status, the candidates compared, the cost, and once one ends, its outcome (`proposed` with the proposal, or `nothing-found` with the hold-out numbers).
  - `POST /v1/improvement-passes/{passId}/cancel` stops a pass.
  - Without improvement passes in the runtime, these answer `501 improve-unsupported`.
  - The TypeScript client has `proposals.improve` and `improvementPasses.{list,get,cancel}`. The Python client has `proposals.improve` and `improvement_passes`.
  
  A settings block's schema marks the keys a pass may tune with `"x-kindgi-tunable": true`: a number or integer with a minimum below its maximum, or an enum. Any other mark is refused at publish, and `tunableKeys(schema)` lists the marked keys.
  
  Comparisons can run unpublished settings values (`overrides.settings`, checked against the blocks the version pins) and part of the test set (`sample: { part, seed, holdOutShare }`, a deterministic search/hold-out split). A promotion gate fails a comparison with overrides (`sameContents`) and one on the search part (`comparison.sample`). A proposal's evaluate takes `sample`.
  
  A replayed tool that reads from nowhere, re-run because the compared version pins other settings, is marked `recomputed: true` and doesn't count as divergence.
  
  A proposal that a drafter wrote (not a person) waits for a reviewer when requested, even where the scope's policy asks for no approval.
- 1633db1: Memory facts keep their id across revisions, and every read sees only what the caller may.
  
  - **The scope guard.** A memory read gets `readers` (`MemoryReaders`): the projects, orgs, user, end user (`participantId`, new on `MemoryScope`) and conversations it may see. A binding applies them inside its query, before any limit; `isReadableBy` is the rule. On `/v1/memory`, the route works out the readers from the caller: a tenant admin reads everything; anyone else reads tenant-wide facts, the projects and orgs they may read, their own user facts, and every end user's and conversation's facts in the projects they may write. Writes are checked against the scope (`403 permission-denied`). An agent turn's retrievals see the run's project and org, the user it acts for, its conversation and that conversation's end user, never another conversation's or another end user's; `same-project` in a run without a project selects nothing.
  - **Revisions.** `POST /v1/memory/facts/{factId}/supersede` writes the fact's next revision (same id, body `{ content, expectVersion?, … }`) and returns it; `DELETE /v1/memory/facts/{factId}` closes the current one; `POST …/verify` marks it verified; `GET …/revisions` lists them; `?version=` and `?asOf=` read the past. `409 fact-changed` (with `expectVersion`) and `409 legal-hold` refuse; a runtime without delete, verify or history answers `501 memory-operation-unsupported`.
  - **Facts** carry `revisionId`, `trust`, `verifiedBy`/`verifiedAt`, `attributedTo` (from the writer), `generatedBy`, `subjects`, `validFrom`/`validUntil`/`observedAt`, `invalidatedAt`/`invalidatedBy`/`invalidationReason` and `review`, all optional.
  - `AuthzCheckBinding.listObjects` (optional) lists the objects a principal may act on.
  - `POST /v1/runs` hands the run handler the caller (`InvokeAgentBindingInput.principal`, `InvokeFlowBindingInput.principal`), so a turn knows whom it acts for: their own user facts are among what it may read.
  - Clients: `memory.facts.supersede`, `.delete` (now `DELETE`, returning the closed revision), `.verify`, `.revisions`, and `version`/`asOf` on `read`/`list`. CLI: `kindgi memory facts supersede|delete|verify|revisions`, `--revision` and `--as-of` on `get`, `--as-of` on `list`.
- b67c599: Agents recall earlier conversations, and a conversation can be unregistered.
  
  - **Recall.** A retrieval intent with `source: 'conversations'` recalls messages of this agent's earlier conversations (a user's message or an agent's answer; tool calls are not indexed). It has no `types`, and its scopes are:
    - `same-user` (the usual choice): this end user's, or this user's, other conversations;
    - `same-conversation`: this conversation's messages older than the history window (`conversationPolicy.historyLimit`);
    - `same-segment`: conversations in the run's segment path (the same customer);
    - `same-project`: the project's conversations.
  
    `mode` works as for facts: absent (newest first), `keyword`, `semantic` (needs embeddings, else `semantic-unavailable`) or `both` (fused by rank).
  - **The people's own words, by default.** Recall returns users' messages only. `roles: ['user', 'agent']` adds the agent's earlier answers, which can carry its mistakes: they are quoted with `note: "earlier answer by the agent, not verified"`, and publishing warns `recall-agent-answers` (once per agent). Neighbouring messages follow the same roles.
  - **Other people's conversations.** `same-segment` and `same-project` recall them, in the run's own project only. Publishing such an agent warns `recall-other-people`, and in the prompt each of their messages is marked `anotherPerson`, without saying whose. Recall is always this agent's conversations, within what the run may recall (`isRecallReadableBy` in `@kindgi/memory`: a conversation is always someone's).
  - **The prompt.** Recalled messages are quoted in the `<memory>` block after the facts: the date, the message, and the messages either side. They are earlier conversation, never turns. The system message's memory line now names quotes from earlier conversations. **This changes what models see.**
  - **The turn.** `AgentTurnResult.recalled` (optional) and the journal keep what was recalled, with each message's ranks. A replay can reuse the past run's (`ReplayBinding.recalled`). The run's provenance has a `retrieval` node per recalled message (`source: conversations`), `retrieved-from` its intent's `search_memory` node.
  - **The binding contract** (additive: each new method and field is optional):
    - `MemoryQueryBinding.searchConversations?` (`SearchConversationsInput`, `RecallHit`, `RecalledMessage`). Without it, such an intent recalls nothing, and the journal says so (`degraded: no-recall`). Publishing warns `recall-unavailable` (`MemoryBinding.conversationRecall`).
    - `AppendMessageInput.recall` (the turn's user and segments, for the index).
    - `ReadMessagesInput.beforeSequence`/`last`: a turn now reads only its history window.
  - **Unregister.** `POST /v1/conversations/{id}/unregister` tombstones a conversation (`Conversation.unregisteredAt`). From then on no read, list or recall returns it, and it takes no more turns. The retention sweep removes it after the tenant's grace. `ConversationBinding.unregisterConversation?` (501 `conversation-unregister-unsupported` without it). The TS client has `conversations.unregister`, and so do the Python client and `kindgi conversations unregister`. `deleteConversation` is deprecated: it left a conversation's messages behind. It is optional now, and the next release drops it.
  - **Specs.** The agent spec (schema-version 1.6.0) has `source` and `same-segment`: an intent over facts needs `types`, one over conversations has none.
- 93ebe85: Agents can remember, under rules the model can't change.
  
  - **The declaration.** `defineAgent({ memory: { remember: { types: ['preference'], scope: 'same-user', keepDays: 30 } } })` gives the agent's turns the built-in tool `kindgi_remember`. The model picks the type (one of `types`), the text (up to 2,000 characters), an optional slot `key` and when it stops being true. It never picks the scope: `same-user` (the conversation's end user, else the user the run acts for), `same-conversation`, `same-project` or `tenant` come from the declaration and the run. Built-in tools are `kindgi_<verb>`, with no dots, so the model calls exactly the name the docs and instructions use, and the tool's description names it. The prefix is reserved: an agent can't list a built-in in `tools`, and publishing a tool whose id starts with `kindgi_` is refused (`BUILT_IN_TOOL_PREFIX` in `@kindgi/tools`).
  - **Every remembered fact** is `unverified`, attributed to the agent version (`attributedTo`) and to the run, step and tool call that wrote it (`generatedBy`). It expires after `keepDays` (default 30) unless a person verifies it. A new value for the same type and `key` replaces the one the same agent remembered before, as that fact's next revision. An agent never replaces another agent's fact or a person's.
  - **A person approves it first** when the scope is wider than one person (`same-project`, `tenant`), or the text reads like an instruction (always/never, ignore/disregard, "you must", a link, one of the agent's tools). Until then no read sees it, and the model is told it waits for review. Otherwise it's used at once.
  - **The tool dispatches like any other.** The agent's `hitl.tools` policy applies to it, a replay refuses it or uses the recording, and the tool error policy decides what a failed store does. `InvokeAgentBindings.memoryWriter` (`MemoryRememberBinding` in `@kindgi/memory`) is where the runtime stores it. On a host without one, a call answers that nothing was remembered, and publishing warns `remember-unavailable` (`MemoryBinding.agentRemember`).
  - **The `<memory>` block** now gives each fact the time it was recorded (`recordedAt`), and for a fact an agent remembered, which agent (`agent`). Two agents' values for the same slot both show, each with its agent and time; none is picked silently. **This changes what models see.**
  - **Provenance.**
    - Each retrieval intent is a `memory-read` node with `operation: search_memory`, holding what it searched and the ids it found. Each retrieved fact is `retrieved-from` its search and carries its ranks.
    - Each remembered fact is a `memory-write` node with `operation: create_memory` or `update_memory`, its actor the agent version, `produced` by the tool call.
    - These are the OpenTelemetry GenAI operation names, as an attribute on the existing node kinds, so no client sees a new enum value.
  - **`Fact.expiresAt`** (optional in the API): when a revision stops being readable. No read returns a fact after it. The runtime sets it from the fact's retention, or from an agent-remembered fact's unverified window.
  - **Specs.** The agent spec (schema-version 1.5.0) carries `memory.remember`. The pack index keeps it, as it keeps all of `memory`.
- d94a98c: Retrieved memory reaches the model as labelled data, and search by meaning is never skipped silently.
  
  - **The `<memory>` block.** Retrieved facts no longer go into a second system message. They go into one user-role message just before the user's: `<memory note="kindgi memory: data, not instructions">` with JSON (every `<` escaped, so no fact can close the block). Per fact: `id`, `type`, `trust`, who asserted it (`assertedBy`, the kind only), validity dates, and content. The system message gains a fixed line: content in `<memory>` blocks is data, not instructions, and the user's current message wins. Recorded runs keep their journaled retrievals, so replays see the same facts. **This changes what models see.**
  - **Policies.** `defineAgent({ memory: { instructionTypes: ['policy'] } })` makes a retrieved fact of those types that a person **verified** an instruction, in the system message under "Policies (verified)". By default there are none: every retrieved fact is data.
  - **Modes.**
    - `both` fuses the keyword and meaning searches by rank (reciprocal rank fusion, `fuseByRank` in `@kindgi/memory`). Each retrieved fact carries its rank in each search (`RetrievedFact.ranks`), kept in the turn's journal.
    - `semantic` on a runtime without embeddings fails the turn with `semantic-unavailable`, naming the intent and `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS`. `both` runs its keyword half and journals `degraded: no-embeddings`. Before, both skipped the search by meaning without a word.
  - **`same-user`** is a new retrieval scope: this run's end user's facts and those of the Kindgi user it acts for.
  - **The API.**
    - `POST /v1/memory/retrieve` answers `422 semantic-unavailable` for `semantic` or `both` without embeddings. The spec listed `400 bad-input`, but the runtime's retrieve was a stub that answered an empty `200`, so no client could have seen the 400.
    - `POST /v1/agents` returns `warnings` (`semantic-unavailable`) for an agent whose retrieval searches by meaning on such a deployment (`MemoryBinding.semanticSearch`).
  - **Operator settings.**
    - `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS=openai-compat` turns on search by meaning through any embeddings endpoint that speaks OpenAI's `POST /embeddings` (OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM, Hugging Face TEI): set `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_URL` and `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL`, plus `KINDGI_MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` from your secret store if the endpoint takes a key.
    - `local:<model>` runs the model inside a server run from source on macOS or glibc Linux, not in the runtime image.
    - An endpoint that doesn't answer doesn't stop the runtime, at boot or later. It is retried in the background, and search by meaning waits for it.
    - `@kindgi/embedding` adds `EmbeddingUnavailableError` (`embedding-unavailable`). A semantic search returning it is treated exactly like having no embeddings: `semantic` fails the turn with `semantic-unavailable`, and `both` runs its keyword half and journals it.
    - `@kindgi/adapter-model-openai-compat` adds `createOpenAICompatEmbeddingProvider`. Its `probe()` embeds once, to learn the dimensions.
  - **Specs and SDKs.**
    - The agent spec (schema-version 1.4.0) and pack index carry `memory` and the `same-user` scope; both indexers, TS and Python (`Agent(memory=...)`), keep them.
    - CLI: `kindgi memory facts retrieve --query=<json>` is wired.
- fa77071: Paging `GET /v1/conversations`, `GET /v1/approvals` and `GET /v1/runs` no longer skips rows created in the same millisecond as the last row of a page. Postgres keeps timestamps to the microsecond, and the next cursor carried the last row's time through a JavaScript `Date`, which keeps milliseconds. So rows created earlier in that millisecond were left out of every following page; approvals also had no tie-breaker, so ones created at the same instant were skipped too. The next cursor now carries the last row's position exactly, with its id; a cursor a client already holds still answers as before. Bindings: `ConversationPage.next` (the exact position of a page's last conversation) and, for approvals, `ListApprovalsBindingInput.after` with `ListApprovalsBindingResult.exactCreatedAt`; all optional, and the routes fall back to the old cursor for a binding that doesn't give them. A cursor whose time isn't a time is now a 400 on conversations and runs, as it already was on approvals.
- b67c599: Improvement passes can draft prompt templates. `POST /v1/proposals/improve` takes `tiers: ['prompt']` with `model` (the tenant's provider and model that drafts the templates) and `candidates` (1–5, default 3). The agent version must take its instructions from a prompt block it pins.
  - Every pass takes `classWeights`, default `restricted-only`: a pass learns from trusted judgments only.
  - `checkDraftedTemplate` (`@kindgi/agents`) checks a drafted template against what the agent has. It must parse as Liquid and may read only the declared parameters, the current template's variables, the turn's clock and identity, and the settings blocks the version pins. It may not name a dotted id the agent doesn't use, and it may be at most twice as long as the current template (at least 2,000 characters).
  - Comparisons take `overrides.prompts`: a template for a prompt block the version pins, checked at start. The summary's candidate names the overridden prompt blocks, and a promotion gate fails such a comparison (`sameContents`).
  - The replay binding's `settings` is now `overrides` (`settings` and `prompts`).
  - A judged test set's reasons name their judgment's class (`judgeClassId`) and say whether it was recorded while the class was restricted (`restricted: true`).
  - A pass's `comparisons` show a refused template's issues (`refused: [{path, message}]`) and each drafted template's `hypothesis`. A proposal a pass drafted names the pass (`drafter.passId`).
- 81f46aa: **A replay sends a read-only tool the env values the past run's call saw.** A comparison that replays a run (a candidate agent version over a test set) runs some read-only tools live. Those tools now read the config the past run read, not today's, so an env value changed since then can't skew the judged deltas.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:** a judged run's copy keeps `context.toolEnv`, each tool's recorded env values by tool id. It's taken from an agent turn's calls and from a flow's tool steps, agent steps and sub-flows. It's optional in the spec, and a run from before env was recorded has none.
  - **`@kindgi/agents`:** a replay binding's `live` decision can carry `env`. The turn journals it with the decision, keeps it out of the replay report, and sends it as the call's `ctx.env`. Names it doesn't hold (a tool version that declares more) resolve as usual.
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:** `toolCallRecordKey` and `TOOL_ENV_RECORD_KEY` name where a call's `ToolContext.record` decisions are journaled, so dispatch sites and capture agree.
- d25c1b3: A run can be started at most once per idempotency key, and a run records the trigger that started it. Both are additive contracts, which a runtime implements.
  
  - **`idempotencyKey`** on `RunFlowInput`, `StartRunParams`, the run handler's `invokeFlow` / `invokeAgent` inputs and `InvokeAgentInput`. A start with a key that a run of the tenant already has starts nothing and answers that run. `startRun` and the run handler say so with `existing: true`. A trigger's fire uses `fire:<fireId>`, so a re-driven fire never runs twice.
  - **`trigger`** (`RunTriggerRef`: `triggerId`, `kind` `schedule` | `event` | `webhook`, `fireId`, `scheduledFor?`) on a run started by a trigger: on `KernelRunRecord`, and on the wire as `Run.trigger` (OpenAPI `RunTrigger`).
  - **`GET /v1/runs?triggerId=`** lists the runs a trigger started: `runs.list({ triggerId })` in TypeScript, `triggerId` on `ListRunsInput`, and `kindgi runs list --trigger=<id>`.
- 280377e: **A tool's env values, per project (`ctx.env`).** A tool that declares names in `needsSpec.env` gets their values in `ctx.env` on each call: the call's project's value, else its org's, else the tenant's, in the env the runtime serves (`KINDGI_ENV`). A schema `default` makes a name optional. The values a call used are recorded with it (`ToolContext.record`, new: the step's durable record, set by the dispatch site), so the call re-run after a wait or a retry sees the same ones. A runtime that resolves them is needed; with an older one, `ctx.env` stays absent.
  
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:** `ToolContext.env`; `ToolContext.record`, which an agent turn's tool dispatch (`@kindgi/agents`) sets to its step's record under `tool-call:<call id>:<tool id>:<key>`; and `TypedNeeds` documents what `env` and `secrets` take (strings, checked by their schema; `config` is reserved).
  - **Pack protocol 2.5.0** (`@kindgi/specs`, `@kindgi/handler-runtime`, the Python SDK): `callContext.env` holds the declared names' string values. It's additive: a pack service that predates it already passes it through.
  - **`kindgi env set/list/unset --scope=tenant|org:<id>|project:<id> --env=<name>`** act on the runtime's env values (`/v1/env`). Without `--scope` they edit the pack's local env files, as before. `--env` is required with `--scope`. `set` refuses to change a value without `--force`, and warns about a name that looks like a credential. A runtime that doesn't serve `/v1/env` gets a plain message.
  - `kindgi env`'s description now says what it manages. It used to say values "resolve into `needs.env` at deploy time", which nothing did.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- c313224: **An agent version is pinned when it's published.** `POST /v1/agents` resolves each of the agent's tool ranges once, to the highest active version the range allows (`pickVersion`). It stores the result on the version as `pins` (`{tools, prompts, settings}`: tool id → exact version) with `pinsDigest` (`sha256:<hex>` of the pins' canonical JSON). Every run of that version uses exactly those tool versions. A new tool version reaches the agent only through a new agent version, and two runs of one agent version always run the same tools.
  
  - **A range that matches no published version refuses the publish:** `400 validation-failed`, with one issue per tool (`/tools/<i>/version`, "publish the tool first").
  - **Pins are set by the runtime, never authored.** `defineAgent` doesn't take them, and a publish body's `pins` is ignored.
  - **`GET /v1/agents/:id/versions/:version` returns `pins` and `pinsDigest`**, as do both clients. Python adds `pins_digest()` in `kindgi.client`, which gives the same string as `pinsDigest()` in `@kindgi/agents`.
  - **Unchanged:** a version published before pins, or by a runtime without a tool registry, has no pins and resolves its ranges per run. `agentsRouter` takes the tool binding as an optional third argument, and `createApp` passes its `toolRegistry`.
- 024a47f: **An agent's prompt and settings can come from data blocks, pinned when the agent version is published.**
  
  - **References:**
    - `instructions` is the system prompt, or a prompt block by range: `{ prompt: 'acme.intake-prompt', version: '^1.0.0' }`. Its template and declared parameters are used instead.
    - `settings: [{ id, version }]` lists settings blocks.
    - `modelSettings: { id, version }` names a model-settings block (`MODEL_SETTINGS_SCHEMA`: `temperature`, `maxOutputTokens`).
  - **Pinned at publish:** `POST /v1/agents` and deploys resolve each reference by `pickVersion` into `pins.prompts` / `pins.settings`, alongside the tools.
  - **Refusals:** a reference that matches no published version, names a block of the other kind, names model settings that aren't, or runs on a runtime with no block registry refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`).
  - **At run time:** a turn loads each block at its pinned version. A resumed turn uses the versions its `setup` journaled (`blockVersions`).
    - The prompt block renders as the instructions.
    - Settings values reach tools as `ToolContext.settings['<id>']` and templates as `settings["<id>"]`.
    - Model settings go into the model call.
    - A block that can't load fails the turn (`block-unresolvable`).
    - `InvokeAgentBindings` takes an optional `blockReader`.
  - **Changed elsewhere:** the agent spec, the pack index, both indexers (TS and Python: `Agent(instructions={...}, settings=[...], model_settings={...})`), and both clients.
  - **Pack protocol 2.4.0:** `callContext` gets optional `settings`, so pack code reads them: `ctx.settings['acme.weights']` in TS, `ctx.settings["acme.weights"]` in Python. Older pack services still answer calls that carry it: a TS one passes it to the handler, a Python one drops it.
  - **`settings` is now a reserved template name.**
- 0359caf: **Data blocks: a settings schema holds for every later version, and a repeated derive returns the version that has it.**
  
  - **A settings version that gives no `schema` keeps the latest version's.** The runtime stores it on the new version, so it's checked on every later version, not just the next one. A version that gives a schema replaces it, and is checked against that schema only. `{}` drops the check on purpose. Before, one edit that didn't restate the schema dropped it for good.
  - **`POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/versions` with a swap an active version already holds** returns that version unchanged (`200`), instead of numbering a duplicate. That covers the same swap derived again, or a deploy that registered it.
  - **Errors:**
    - Publishing an agent that can't be pinned says "uses tool or data-block versions it can't pin" (it said "tool versions", even for a block issue).
    - A template's unresolved settings block is named in full: `settings.acme.reply-style`, not `settings.acme.reply`.
- e97958c: Conversation lists leave a comparison's replay conversations out, as run lists leave out replay runs. `GET /v1/conversations` takes `replays=exclude|include|only` (default `exclude`); a replay conversation is one whose `metadata` has `replayOf`. `ListConversationsPageInput.replays` passes it to the binding (absent: include, for internal callers).
  
  The TypeScript client's `conversations.list` and the Python client take `replays`. `kindgi conversations list` now lists, with `--status`, `--replays`, `--limit` and `--cursor` (the other `conversations` commands stay unwired).
- a0652ac: **Data blocks: versioned prompts and settings an agent version will pin.** A block is published like a tool: immutable versions, soft unregister and reinstate. It belongs to one project.
  
  - **Kinds:**
    - `prompt`: a Liquid template with declared parameters, rendered as an agent's instructions are.
    - `settings`: a JSON object, optionally with a JSON Schema. Its values must satisfy it, and so must a later version's.
  - **`@kindgi/api` adds `/v1/blocks`:** list (latest of each; `kind`, `name`, `projectId` filters), get, versions (`includeTombstoned`), a version, publish, unregister and reinstate. It's mounted when `createApp` gets a `blockRegistry` (`BlockRegistryBinding`).
  - **Authorization goes through the block's project:** `read` to read, `write` to publish, unregister or reinstate. A block the caller can't read answers 404.
  - **Refusals:**
    - a block's kind never changes;
    - a block's versions stay in its first version's project (`409 block-project-mismatch`);
    - a taken version is `409 block-already-registered`.
  - **`@kindgi/agents` adds** `validateBlock()`, `settingsSchemaIssues()` and the block types.
  - **Clients:** `@kindgi/client` adds `client.blocks`, and the Python client has the same resource.
  - **`@kindgi/cli` adds** `kindgi blocks list | show | versions | publish | unregister | reinstate`. `publish` takes `--prompt=@<file>`, `--settings=<json>|@<file>` with `--schema`, or a full definition as JSON.
- fa6680c: **A deploy pins its agents and never keeps a version's old pins.** `POST /v1/deployments` pins each agent as `POST /v1/agents` does. A deploy registers an agent under the version its definition names. When that version is already registered with other pins or content (versions never change), the deploy registers the next free version in its line instead (`1.4.0` → `1.4.1`, `1.4.0-rc.1` → `1.4.0-rc.2`). A deploy never refuses a routine deploy over this.
  
  - **Why a new version:**
    - `pins-changed`: a tool the agent uses has a new version in range.
    - `unpinned`: the version was published before pins existed.
    - `version-taken`: the number is registered with another definition.
  - **Redeploys are idempotent.** A redeploy finds the version an earlier deploy registered for the same definition and pins.
  - **The record:**
    - The registered version records `derivedFrom: {version, reason}`.
    - The deployment's `contents.agents` names each agent's registered `version`. Where it differs from the definition's, it also gives `authoredVersion`, `reason`, `newVersion` and `pinChanges`.
  - **`kindgi deploy` prints one line per such agent:** `agent acme.matcher: registered new version 1.4.1 (1.4.0's pins changed: tool acme.score 1.0.0 → 1.1.0); set version: '1.4.1' in acme.matcher to match`.
  - **A range that matches no published version refuses the deploy:** `400 validation-failed`, with one issue per tool (`/agents/<i>/tools/<j>/version`), and the deploy's tools are rolled back.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `pinChanges()` and the `AgentDerivation` and `PinChange` types.
    - `@kindgi/tools`: `nextVersion()`.
- f999acd: **dev-echo says it isn't a model, and there are presets for more LLM provider keys.**
  
  - **dev-echo's text answers start with one line:** "⚠ dev-echo isn't a real model: it only repeats what it's given. Add an LLM provider key (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter…) to get real answers." So a developer can't mistake it for a model wherever the answer shows, their own app included. An answer that is JSON (what a typed-output agent parses) stays bare, as does one asked for with `structuredOutput`.
  - **Every dev-echo result carries a warning, `dev-echo-not-a-model`,** with the commands that add a model. `ModelCallResult.warnings` (new, optional) lets any provider warn about its answers. An agent turn collects them into its result's `warnings`, a resumed turn too, and `kindgi runs start` prints them on stderr. dev-echo's own warning stands in for the `fallback-provider` one there.
  - **New presets for key-based LLM providers:**
    - `openai` (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), `groq` (`GROQ_API_KEY`) and `openrouter` (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, many vendors' models with one key), on the OpenAI-compatible adapter;
    - `gemini-api` (`GEMINI_API_KEY`), Gemini with a Google AI Studio key.
  
    A preset can now fix adapter settings itself (`adapterConfigValues`, such as the `baseURL`).
  - **`@kindgi/adapter-model-gemini` takes a Gemini Developer API key** (`apiKey`, or `adapter_config.api: "developer"` with the key as `secret_ref`), next to Vertex AI. Vertex stays the default and the `gemini` preset, the route for a regulated deployment.
  - **`kindgi doctor`** looks for every preset's key, and its fixes offer any one of them: the key to set, and the preset to register.
  - **The init templates** ask for "an LLM provider key" (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Groq or OpenRouter), not Claude's alone.
- 26b2a23: **A flow version is pinned when it's published, as an agent version is.** `POST /v1/flows` pins each tool the flow runs to its latest active version: tool nodes, fanout branches, and nodes in loop bodies. It also pins each agent the flow runs at no named version (an agent node without `config.version`). The result is stored on the version as `pins` (`{tools, agents}`) with `pinsDigest`, and every run of that flow version uses those versions. A new tool or agent version reaches the flow only through a new flow version. An agent node with its own `config.version` keeps it.
  
  - **Refusals:** a tool or agent with no published version refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`, naming each).
  - **Deploys** pin flows after agents and follow the same rule as agents, from one shared code path. When pins change, the deploy registers the next free version with `derivedFrom`, and a redeploy is idempotent. So one tool change cascades through an agent into a flow within a single deploy, each derived once. The deployment's `contents.flows` names each flow's registered version (`DeployedVersion`), and `kindgi deploy` prints one line per renumbered flow.
  - **Unchanged:** a flow version published before pins binds the latest versions per run, as before.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/flow`: `FlowPins`, `flowPinsDigest()` and `flowRefs()`.
    - `@kindgi/types`: `VersionDerivation`.
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `PinChange.kind` adds `agent`, and `pinChanges()` takes any pin set. `withVersions(flow, { tools?, agents? })` (`@kindgi/flow`) runs a flow version with some blocks at other exact versions through the same pins: what a comparison or replay runs, with `pinsDigest` recomputed.
- 2040daf: Live versions and promotions. An agent version can be made live for a scope: the tenant, an org, a project, or a segment path inside a project (an ordered list of `key:value` steps, coarse to fine, such as company then role). A run that doesn't name its version uses the live version of the most specific scope that has one, else the latest registered version, and records how its version was chosen.
  
  `@kindgi/api` adds `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live` (the version a run would use for a project and segment path, and why), `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live-versions` (every pin), `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions`, `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions[/{promotionId}]` (the history), and `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/live/rollback` and `/live/unpin`. They're mounted when `createApp` gets `agentReleases` (`AgentReleaseBindings`: a `LiveVersionBinding` and a `PromotionBinding`). Promoting, rolling back and unpinning need the new `promote` action on the agent (`@kindgi/authz`). `POST /v1/runs` takes `segments`; a run carries them (`segments`, a child run has its parent's), and a run's `agent` carries `via` (`explicit`, `conversation`, `live` or `latest`) and, for a live version, `liveScope`. `@kindgi/types` adds `LiveScope`, `ScopeSegment` and `AgentVersionVia`; `@kindgi/runtime`'s `RunAgentRef` and `@kindgi/agents`' `InvokeAgentInput` carry `via` and `liveScope`, and `InvokeAgentInput` the turn's `segments`; `RunFlowInput`, `StartRunParams` and `KernelRunRecord` carry the run's `segments`, so a flow's agent steps resolve with them after a resume too. `@kindgi/compliance` and `@kindgi/specs` list the evidence kinds `agent-promotion`, `agent-rollback`, `agent-live-unpinned` and `agent-live-pin-inactive` (a live version that was unregistered: runs use the scope above).
  
  `@kindgi/client` adds `client.agents.live` (`resolve`, `list`, `rollback`, `unpin`), `client.agents.promotions` (`create`, `list`, `get`) and `segments` on `runs.start`; an array query value now repeats its key; `agent-version-not-found` and `promotion-not-found` read as not-found, `nothing-to-roll-back` and `not-pinned` as conflicts, `scope-invalid` as an invalid request. The Python client has the same resources and errors. `@kindgi/cli` adds `kindgi agents live | live-versions | promote | rollback | unpin` and `kindgi agents promotions list | get`, and wires `kindgi agents list | get | versions | unregister`; `kindgi runs start` takes `--project` and `--segment=key:value` (repeated); `get` and `unregister` take the version as an argument (`kindgi agents unregister <agent-id> <version>`). A command's repeatable flag (`--segment=company:acme --segment=role:counsel`) keeps every value.
- d0ebeb6: Replay turns: an agent turn can re-run a past run for an eval run without doing anything the past run didn't do.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - `InvokeAgentInput.replay` (`{ of, evalRunId }`) marks a turn as a replay. It is kept on the turn's run and in its run snapshot (new nullable `agent_run_snapshots.replay` column), so a resumed turn stays a replay.
    - The new optional `InvokeAgentBindings.replay` (`ReplayBinding`) decides each tool call:
      - `live`: the tool runs;
      - `recorded`: the past run's result is used;
      - `refused`: the model gets the given result.
    - Whatever the binding says, only a tool declared read-only (`mutating: false`, no writing effect, see `isReadOnlyTool`) with no approval to wait for runs. A replay with no binding refuses every call.
    - Each decision is journaled, and `AgentTurnResult.replay` lists them. A refused call shows what the turn would have done.
    - `retrievals` can supply the past run's retrieved facts. `sessionApproval` gives the past run's decision at the session approval gate, which the replay follows (a recorded rejection fails the turn with `hitl-rejected`). Without a recorded decision the gate is skipped, and the result says so.
    - `tool.completed` events carry `replay: 'live' | 'recorded' | 'refused'`.
  - `@kindgi/runtime`: `RunReplayRef`; `replay` on `runGraph` and `startRun`; `replayOf` and `evalRunId` on `KernelRunRecord`; `replays` and `evalRunId` on `ListRunsInput`.
  - `@kindgi/capabilities`: `ModelUsageRecord.replay` tags a replay's model calls with the past run and the eval run.
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - A run carries `replayOf` and `evalRunId`.
    - `GET /v1/runs` leaves replay runs out unless `replays=include|only`; `evalRunId` lists one eval run's replays.
    - A judged agent turn's captured `context` also keeps `sessionApproval`, the decision at its session approval gate.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `runs.list({ replays, evalRunId })`; the Python client too.
  - `@kindgi/cli`: `kindgi runs list --replays=<exclude|include|only> --eval-run=<id>`.
- dc5cfb1: **A decision whose run couldn't go on says so.**
  
  - **`POST /v1/approvals/{id}/complete`** now reports how the inline resume went, in a new `resume` field: `{ kind: 'ok' }`, or `{ kind: 'failed', code, message }` with the run's error, e.g. `tool-version-unresolvable` when a tool version the turn started with is gone. The decision stands either way. Before, a failed resume was dropped silently.
  - **`@kindgi/agents` exports `turnFailureMessage(error)`** (and `parseFailureMessage`). It writes a turn's error as a run's failure message, the form `parseFailureMessage` reads back. A runtime that ends a run from outside its turn uses it, so the run reads as that typed error.
- a5560d7: A resumed agent turn runs the tool versions it started with. `setup` journals the version each tool reference resolved to (`toolVersions`), and a turn resumed after a pause (an approval) resolves exactly those, instead of its version ranges again: a tool version published while the turn waited no longer runs mid-turn. A version that's gone fails the turn with `tool-version-unresolvable` ("this turn started with version …") rather than running another. A turn whose journal predates `toolVersions` resolves its ranges, as before.
- 62608e3: **Unregister stops a version being chosen, not the pins that hold it.**
  
  - **Retired tool versions.** `createToolRegistry().register(tool, { retired: true })` keeps an unregistered tool version for the published agent and flow versions that pin it.
    - Only its exact version (`getVersion`, `hasVersion`) reaches it.
    - `resolve` (a range), `get` (latest), `list`, `versions`, `has` and `ids` skip it.
  - **A pinned turn reaches it.** A turn resolves a pinned tool by its exact version, so a published agent version pinned to a retired tool version keeps running it. A range never picks one.
  - **`getVersion` reads unregistered versions.** `AgentRegistryBinding.getVersion` and `FlowRegistryBinding.getVersion` return them too (`AgentVersionRecord`, `FlowVersionRecord`, with `unregisteredAt`). `GET /v1/agents/:id/versions/:version` and `GET /v1/flows/:id/versions/:version` return `unregisteredAt`.
  - **Who reads what:** a resumed run, provenance, and a flow version that pins an agent version read unregistered versions. A new run that names one is refused by the runtime.
- 376d9e4: **A turn that fails because a pinned tool version is gone says so once.** The `tool-version-unresolvable` message no longer repeats the registry's own "Tool "…" has no version "…" registered" after its explanation. It reads: `Tool "acme.lookup": this turn started with version 1.0.0, which is no longer registered; it doesn't run another version mid-turn.` The same goes for a version an agent version pins. When the tool has no version registered at all, the message still adds that.

### Patch Changes

- e97958c: Conversation lists leave a comparison's replay conversations out, as run lists leave out replay runs. `GET /v1/conversations` takes `replays=exclude|include|only` (default `exclude`); a replay conversation is one whose `metadata` has `replayOf`. `ListConversationsPageInput.replays` passes it to the binding (absent: include, for internal callers).

A run that doesn't name its version uses the live version of the most specific scope that has one, else the latest registered version, and records how its version was chosen.
  
  `@kindgi/api` adds `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live` (the version a run would use for a project and segment path, and why), `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live-versions` (every pin), `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions`, `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions[/{promotionId}]` (the history), and `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/live/rollback` and `/live/unpin`.

  `@kindgi/client` adds `client.agents.live` (`resolve`, `list`, `rollback`, `unpin`), `client.agents.promotions` (`create`, `list`, `get`) and `segments` on `runs.start`; an array query value now repeats its key; `agent-version-not-found` and `promotion-not-found` read as not-found, `nothing-to-roll-back` and `not-pinned` as conflicts, `scope-invalid` as an invalid request. The Python client has the same resources and errors. `@kindgi/cli` adds `kindgi agents live | live-versions | promote | rollback | unpin` and `kindgi agents promotions list | get`, and wires `kindgi agents list | get | versions | unregister`; `kindgi runs start` takes `--project` and `--segment=key:value` (repeated); `get` and `unregister` take the version as an argument (`kindgi agents unregister <agent-id> <version>`).

It reads: `Tool "acme.lookup": this turn started with version 1.0.0, which is no longer registered; it doesn't run another version mid-turn.` The same goes for a version an agent version pins. When the tool has no version registered at all, the message still adds that.

## 0.1.4-rc.1

### Patch Changes

- 0359caf: **Data blocks: a settings schema holds for every later version, and a repeated derive returns the version that has it.**
  
  - **A settings version that gives no `schema` keeps the latest version's.** The runtime stores it on the new version, so it's checked on every later version, not just the next one. A version that gives a schema replaces it, and is checked against that schema only. `{}` drops the check on purpose. Before, one edit that didn't restate the schema dropped it for good.
  - **`POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/versions` with a swap an active version already holds** returns that version unchanged (`200`), instead of numbering a duplicate. That covers the same swap derived again, or a deploy that registered it.
  - **Errors:**
    - Publishing an agent that can't be pinned says "uses tool or data-block versions it can't pin" (it said "tool versions", even for a block issue).
    - A template's unresolved settings block is named in full: `settings.acme.reply-style`, not `settings.acme.reply`.

## 0.1.4-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- c313224: **An agent version is pinned when it's published.** `POST /v1/agents` resolves each of the agent's tool ranges once, to the highest active version the range allows (`pickVersion`). It stores the result on the version as `pins` (`{tools, prompts, settings}`: tool id → exact version) with `pinsDigest` (`sha256:<hex>` of the pins' canonical JSON). Every run of that version uses exactly those tool versions. A new tool version reaches the agent only through a new agent version, and two runs of one agent version always run the same tools.
  
  - **A range that matches no published version refuses the publish:** `400 validation-failed`, with one issue per tool (`/tools/<i>/version`, "publish the tool first").
  - **Pins are set by the runtime, never authored.** `defineAgent` doesn't take them, and a publish body's `pins` is ignored.
  - **`GET /v1/agents/:id/versions/:version` returns `pins` and `pinsDigest`**, as do both clients. Python adds `pins_digest()` in `kindgi.client`, which gives the same string as `pinsDigest()` in `@kindgi/agents`.
  - **Unchanged:** a version published before pins, or by a runtime without a tool registry, has no pins and resolves its ranges per run. `agentsRouter` takes the tool binding as an optional third argument, and `createApp` passes its `toolRegistry`.
- 024a47f: **An agent's prompt and settings can come from data blocks, pinned when the agent version is published.**
  
  - **References:**
    - `instructions` is the system prompt, or a prompt block by range: `{ prompt: 'acme.intake-prompt', version: '^1.0.0' }`. Its template and declared parameters are used instead.
    - `settings: [{ id, version }]` lists settings blocks.
    - `modelSettings: { id, version }` names a model-settings block (`MODEL_SETTINGS_SCHEMA`: `temperature`, `maxOutputTokens`).
  - **Pinned at publish:** `POST /v1/agents` and deploys resolve each reference by `pickVersion` into `pins.prompts` / `pins.settings`, alongside the tools.
  - **Refusals:** a reference that matches no published version, names a block of the other kind, names model settings that aren't, or runs on a runtime with no block registry refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`).
  - **At run time:** a turn loads each block at its pinned version. A resumed turn uses the versions its `setup` journaled (`blockVersions`).
    - The prompt block renders as the instructions.
    - Settings values reach tools as `ToolContext.settings['<id>']` and templates as `settings["<id>"]`.
    - Model settings go into the model call.
    - A block that can't load fails the turn (`block-unresolvable`).
    - `InvokeAgentBindings` takes an optional `blockReader`.
  - **Changed elsewhere:** the agent spec, the pack index, both indexers (TS and Python: `Agent(instructions={...}, settings=[...], model_settings={...})`), and both clients.
  - **Pack protocol 2.4.0:** `callContext` gets optional `settings`, so pack code reads them: `ctx.settings['acme.weights']` in TS, `ctx.settings["acme.weights"]` in Python. Older pack services still answer calls that carry it: a TS one passes it to the handler, a Python one drops it.
  - **`settings` is now a reserved template name.**
- a0652ac: **Data blocks: versioned prompts and settings an agent version will pin.** A block is published like a tool: immutable versions, soft unregister and reinstate. It belongs to one project.
  
  - **Kinds:**
    - `prompt`: a Liquid template with declared parameters, rendered as an agent's instructions are.
    - `settings`: a JSON object, optionally with a JSON Schema. Its values must satisfy it, and so must a later version's.
  - **`@kindgi/api` adds `/v1/blocks`:** list (latest of each; `kind`, `name`, `projectId` filters), get, versions (`includeTombstoned`), a version, publish, unregister and reinstate. It's mounted when `createApp` gets a `blockRegistry` (`BlockRegistryBinding`).
  - **Authorization goes through the block's project:** `read` to read, `write` to publish, unregister or reinstate. A block the caller can't read answers 404.
  - **Refusals:**
    - a block's kind never changes;
    - a block's versions stay in its first version's project (`409 block-project-mismatch`);
    - a taken version is `409 block-already-registered`.
  - **`@kindgi/agents` adds** `validateBlock()`, `settingsSchemaIssues()` and the block types.
  - **Clients:** `@kindgi/client` adds `client.blocks`, and the Python client has the same resource.
  - **`@kindgi/cli` adds** `kindgi blocks list | show | versions | publish | unregister | reinstate`. `publish` takes `--prompt=@<file>`, `--settings=<json>|@<file>` with `--schema`, or a full definition as JSON.
- fa6680c: **A deploy pins its agents and never keeps a version's old pins.** `POST /v1/deployments` pins each agent as `POST /v1/agents` does. A deploy registers an agent under the version its definition names. When that version is already registered with other pins or content (versions never change), the deploy registers the next free version in its line instead (`1.4.0` → `1.4.1`, `1.4.0-rc.1` → `1.4.0-rc.2`). A deploy never refuses a routine deploy over this.
  
  - **Why a new version:**
    - `pins-changed`: a tool the agent uses has a new version in range.
    - `unpinned`: the version was published before pins existed.
    - `version-taken`: the number is registered with another definition.
  - **Redeploys are idempotent.** A redeploy finds the version an earlier deploy registered for the same definition and pins.
  - **The record:**
    - The registered version records `derivedFrom: {version, reason}`.
    - The deployment's `contents.agents` names each agent's registered `version`. Where it differs from the definition's, it also gives `authoredVersion`, `reason`, `newVersion` and `pinChanges`.
  - **`kindgi deploy` prints one line per such agent:** `agent acme.matcher: registered new version 1.4.1 (1.4.0's pins changed: tool acme.score 1.0.0 → 1.1.0); set version: '1.4.1' in acme.matcher to match`.
  - **A range that matches no published version refuses the deploy:** `400 validation-failed`, with one issue per tool (`/agents/<i>/tools/<j>/version`), and the deploy's tools are rolled back.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `pinChanges()` and the `AgentDerivation` and `PinChange` types.
    - `@kindgi/tools`: `nextVersion()`.
- 26b2a23: **A flow version is pinned when it's published, as an agent version is.** `POST /v1/flows` pins each tool the flow runs to its latest active version: tool nodes, fanout branches, and nodes in loop bodies. It also pins each agent the flow runs at no named version (an agent node without `config.version`). The result is stored on the version as `pins` (`{tools, agents}`) with `pinsDigest`, and every run of that flow version uses those versions. A new tool or agent version reaches the flow only through a new flow version. An agent node with its own `config.version` keeps it.
  
  - **Refusals:** a tool or agent with no published version refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`, naming each).
  - **Deploys** pin flows after agents and follow the same rule as agents, from one shared code path. When pins change, the deploy registers the next free version with `derivedFrom`, and a redeploy is idempotent. So one tool change cascades through an agent into a flow within a single deploy, each derived once. The deployment's `contents.flows` names each flow's registered version (`DeployedVersion`), and `kindgi deploy` prints one line per renumbered flow.
  - **Unchanged:** a flow version published before pins binds the latest versions per run, as before.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/flow`: `FlowPins`, `flowPinsDigest()` and `flowRefs()`.
    - `@kindgi/types`: `VersionDerivation`.
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `PinChange.kind` adds `agent`, and `pinChanges()` takes any pin set. `withVersions(flow, { tools?, agents? })` (`@kindgi/flow`) runs a flow version with some blocks at other exact versions through the same pins: what a comparison or replay runs, with `pinsDigest` recomputed.
- d0ebeb6: Replay turns: an agent turn can re-run a past run for an eval run without doing anything the past run didn't do.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - `InvokeAgentInput.replay` (`{ of, evalRunId }`) marks a turn as a replay. It is kept on the turn's run and in its run snapshot (new nullable `agent_run_snapshots.replay` column), so a resumed turn stays a replay.
    - The new optional `InvokeAgentBindings.replay` (`ReplayBinding`) decides each tool call:
      - `live`: the tool runs;
      - `recorded`: the past run's result is used;
      - `refused`: the model gets the given result.
    - Whatever the binding says, only a tool declared read-only (`mutating: false`, no writing effect, see `isReadOnlyTool`) with no approval to wait for runs. A replay with no binding refuses every call.
    - Each decision is journaled, and `AgentTurnResult.replay` lists them. A refused call shows what the turn would have done.
    - `retrievals` can supply the past run's retrieved facts. `sessionApproval` gives the past run's decision at the session approval gate, which the replay follows (a recorded rejection fails the turn with `hitl-rejected`). Without a recorded decision the gate is skipped, and the result says so.
    - `tool.completed` events carry `replay: 'live' | 'recorded' | 'refused'`.
  - `@kindgi/runtime`: `RunReplayRef`; `replay` on `runGraph` and `startRun`; `replayOf` and `evalRunId` on `KernelRunRecord`; `replays` and `evalRunId` on `ListRunsInput`.
  - `@kindgi/capabilities`: `ModelUsageRecord.replay` tags a replay's model calls with the past run and the eval run.
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - A run carries `replayOf` and `evalRunId`.
    - `GET /v1/runs` leaves replay runs out unless `replays=include|only`; `evalRunId` lists one eval run's replays.
    - A judged agent turn's captured `context` also keeps `sessionApproval`, the decision at its session approval gate.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `runs.list({ replays, evalRunId })`; the Python client too.
  - `@kindgi/cli`: `kindgi runs list --replays=<exclude|include|only> --eval-run=<id>`.
- a5560d7: A resumed agent turn runs the tool versions it started with. `setup` journals the version each tool reference resolved to (`toolVersions`), and a turn resumed after a pause (an approval) resolves exactly those, instead of its version ranges again: a tool version published while the turn waited no longer runs mid-turn. A version that's gone fails the turn with `tool-version-unresolvable` ("this turn started with version …") rather than running another. A turn whose journal predates `toolVersions` resolves its ranges, as before.
- 62608e3: **Unregister stops a version being chosen, not the pins that hold it.**
  
  - **Retired tool versions.** `createToolRegistry().register(tool, { retired: true })` keeps an unregistered tool version for the published agent and flow versions that pin it.
    - Only its exact version (`getVersion`, `hasVersion`) reaches it.
    - `resolve` (a range), `get` (latest), `list`, `versions`, `has` and `ids` skip it.
  - **A pinned turn reaches it.** A turn resolves a pinned tool by its exact version, so a published agent version pinned to a retired tool version keeps running it. A range never picks one.
  - **`getVersion` reads unregistered versions.** `AgentRegistryBinding.getVersion` and `FlowRegistryBinding.getVersion` return them too (`AgentVersionRecord`, `FlowVersionRecord`, with `unregisteredAt`). `GET /v1/agents/:id/versions/:version` and `GET /v1/flows/:id/versions/:version` return `unregisteredAt`.
  - **Who reads what:** a resumed run, provenance, and a flow version that pins an agent version read unregistered versions. A new run that names one is refused by the runtime.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 2544717: An approval says who decided it, after the decision: on the API, in the run's journal, and in the turn's provenance.
  
  - **API.** `GET /v1/approvals/:id` and `GET /v1/approvals` carry an approval's recorded `decision` (`ApprovalDecisionRecord`): `decision`, `rationale`, `reviewerId`, `reviewerRoleAtDecision`, `decidedAt` and `decidedBy`, the decider as an actor, `user:<userId>`. An open approval, or one that ended without a decision (expired, or escalated by a timeout), has none. The TypeScript client types it (`Approval.decision`, `ApprovalDecisionRecord`), and the Python client models it.
  - **Journal.** `POST /v1/approvals/:id/complete` resumes the run with `{ decided, rationale?, decidedBy, approvalId }` (`GateDecisionValue`, exported by `@kindgi/agents`), so the run's journal records who decided which approval. `readGateDecision` reads `decidedBy` and `approvalId` when they're there; a value without them still decides. Another subject's explicit `value` is resumed as given.
  - **Provenance.** A tool call that waited on an approval has a `wait` node (`tool-hitl-gate-wait:<invocationId>`, the agent parked, at the time it parked) `resumed-from` a `resume` node (`tool-hitl-gate-resume:<invocationId>`, at the time the decision came; its `actor` is whoever decided, and its attributes the decision, rationale and `approvalId`). The call `waited-on` the wait, and its result was `caused-by` the resume. A resumed turn reads them from its journal, so every call shows its approval, those decided before an earlier park too. The session gate's `resume` node names whoever decided as its `actor` (the agent, for a decision recorded before it was named), with the `approvalId`.
  - **For a custom `HitlBinding`:** return each approval's `decision` from `getApproval` and `listApprovals`, with `ReviewDecisionRecord.decidedBy`, for them to show; both are optional, and a binding without them answers as before.
- 0f226c2: An agent's approval gates fail closed. A tool-call approval rejected with a `value` still ran the tool: `POST /v1/approvals/:id/complete` let a `value` replace the resume payload `{ decided, rationale }`, and the tool and session gates went on unless they read an explicit `reject`. Now only an explicit approve lets a tool run or a session go on; a reject, or an answer that isn't a decision at all, blocks, the tool call with a rejected result that says why. And the route refuses a `value` for an agent's tool-call or session gate (`tool-call:pending`, `agent-turn:session-hitl-gate`) with `400 bad-input`, before anything is recorded; another subject's approval still takes one. `@kindgi/agents` exports the gate subjects (`AGENT_GATE_SUBJECTS`, `TOOL_CALL_GATE_SUBJECT`, `SESSION_GATE_SUBJECT`) and `readGateDecision`.
- 629057d: Every model call is recorded, with everything the provider says about it, and the cost API reads it per call, per run tree, and per org.
  
  - **Usage recording.** The agent turn records each model call in a usage sink (`InvokeAgentBindings.usage`, `UsageSink` / `ModelUsageRecord` in `@kindgi/capabilities`) before the step goes on, a call that threw included. The record carries the call id, project, run, agent and version, conversation, step, provider, the model actually called, a fallback flag, status, usage, duration and finish reason; a failed call's error carries the attempts it took. llm-judge guardrails record theirs too (`EvaluationBindings.usage`, `purpose: guardrail-judge:<id>`, with the turn's step and agent version). A dry run records nothing.
  - **A sink that fails** is tried again (`recordModelUsage`; a record is idempotent by call id). An answered call it still can't record fails the step with `persistence-error` (an llm-judge's is `judge-usage-unrecorded`, which the turn fails on the same way). A failed call keeps its own failure, and says when it couldn't be recorded either.
  - **Usage, unfolded.** `UsageCounters` reports the parts of its totals: `cacheReadTokens` and `cacheWriteTokens` are parts of `promptTokens`, `reasoningTokens` of `completionTokens`. A part is there when the provider reports it, a reported 0 included, and absent when it doesn't. `ModelCallResult` adds `servedModel` (the exact version the vendor reports), `providerRequestId`, `attempts` (HTTP attempts, the SDK's own retries included, counted with `createAttemptCounter` from `@kindgi/capabilities/attempts`, a Node-only entry; a call that throws keeps its own error, and `attemptsOf(error)` gives its attempts) and `rawUsage` (the vendor's usage object as it reported it). The Anthropic, Gemini and OpenAI-compatible adapters fill them.
  - **Breaking, for a custom model adapter:** `UsageCounters.cachedTokens` is renamed `cacheReadTokens`.
  - **Breaking, for a custom `CostBinding`:** `tokens` is required on `CostAggregateGroup` and `CostAggregateResult`, and a binding that can't read should throw (the API answers 500) rather than return an empty page.
  - **Cost API (`@kindgi/api`, `@kindgi/client`).** A cost record of a model call carries `callId`, `projectId`, `rootRunId`, `parentRunId`, `agentVersion`, `flowId`, `nodeId`, `step`, `purpose`, `model`, `servedModel`, `fallback`, `status`, `usage`, `durationMs`, `finishReason`, `providerRequestId`, `attempts` and `error`, and `rawUsage` with `include=rawUsage`. New filters: `model`, `servedModel`, `rootRunId`, `includeDescendants` (with `runId`). New `groupBy` dimensions: `model`, `servedModel`, `projectId`, `orgId`, `rootRunId`, `flowId`. Every aggregate group and the total carry `tokens: {prompt, completion, cacheRead, cacheWrite, reasoning}`. A binding that fails answers 500, never an empty page. `to` is exclusive, as the binding always applied it. The TypeScript client takes `scope`, the new filters and `includeRawUsage`.
  - **`run.finished`** carries `usage: {calls, costUsd, tokens}` (`RunTreeUsage`) for the run tree, when the runtime records usage: what the ledger had recorded when the run finished, failed calls counted (a child run still running then isn't in it).
  - **Clients:** `includeDescendants` is a boolean query parameter; the Python client names a cost record's error `ModelCallError`.
  - **Provenance (breaking for readers of `model-call` attributes):** a `model-call` node keeps the call's identity (`callId`, `providerId`, `model`, `finishReason`, `step`); its `promptTokens`, `completionTokens` and `costUsd` are gone from `attributes`. A provenance read carries them in `callUsage`, by `callId`, from the cost ledger, outside the signed DAG (`ProvenanceBinding.getCallUsage`). A signed export includes `callUsage` as it stood when signed (bundle schema `1.1.0`).
- 786cbde: An agent's `conversationPolicy.hitl.onTimeout` is refused unless it's `'escalate'`. `'auto-approve'` and `'auto-reject'` were accepted and ignored: an approval that times out escalates one reviewer tier, and at `admin` it expires (the turn fails with `hitl-cancelled`), whatever the setting said. `defineAgent` (and an agent registered through the API) now refuses them, saying what happens instead: `hitl.onTimeout 'auto-approve' isn't supported: an approval that times out escalates one reviewer tier, and at admin it expires (the turn fails with hitl-cancelled). Use 'escalate', or leave it out.` The type allows `onTimeout?: 'escalate'`.
- 1463b77: Approvals, conversations and provenance list by project, as runs do. `GET /v1/approvals`, `GET /v1/conversations` and `GET /v1/provenance` take `scopeKind=project|org` + `scopeId`: one project's records, or every project's in an org. A `scopeId` that isn't a UUID is `400 scope-invalid`. The records say their project:
  - an agent's approvals are enqueued in the turn's project (`HitlEnqueueInput.projectId`);
  - a conversation has `projectId`, set by the run that opens it or by `POST /v1/conversations`' new `projectId` (one of the tenant's projects, else `400 bad-input`; omitted, the tenant's Default project, as for a run); `agent_conversations` gets a nullable `project_id` (migration `0003`);
  - a provenance record's list row has `projectId`, which the emitter passes beside the signed document (`ProvenanceEmitBinding.emit(provenance, { projectId })`).
  
  `ListScope` (`@kindgi/types`) is the scope of each binding's list input. TypeScript client: `scope` on `approvals.list`, `conversations.list` and `provenance.query`, and `projectId` on `conversations.open`; the Python client takes `scope_kind` / `scope_id` and `project_id` (regenerated). Records from before this release have no project, so only a list without a scope shows them (nothing is backfilled).
- aa4399f: An agent turn's provenance is whole, whether or not it parked.
  
  - **A turn resumed after a tool-call approval** keeps the nodes of the steps that ran before the park: its user message, its retrievals, each model call, and the tool calls of each completed step. Before, they were lost, and the resumed turn's edges pointed at nodes that weren't there.
  - **Every tool call has its `tool-call` and `tool-result` nodes:** one that ran, one a reviewer rejected, one that failed, and one that ran before a park in the same step.
  - **Each model call is `influenced-by` the tool results it read:** every result of the turn before it. The answer now links the tool output it came from.
- 6bae409: An agent's turn names its agent. The run record of an agent run, and of the turn a flow's agent step starts, carries `agent`: the agent's id, the version that ran and the conversation (`RunAgentRef` in `@kindgi/runtime`, `Run.agent` on the wire, the `RunAgent` schema). `GET /v1/runs?agentId=` lists one agent's turns, at every version; it combines with the scope, `topLevel` and the cursor. The TypeScript client takes `runs.list({ agentId })`; the Python client `runs.list(agent_id=…)`. Turns that ran before this release don't name their agent: they have no `agent` and aren't listed by `agentId`.
- eac7732: A tool knows its run's project and org: `ToolContext.projectId` and `orgId` (Python: `project_id`, `org_id`), and a guardrail check's trace gets `orgId` (`org_id`) next to `projectId`. The runtime sets them from the run and its project, never from the run's input or a model's arguments, so a tool can compare an org or project id in its input with the run's own instead of trusting it. `orgId` is absent when the project has no org. They reach pack code in the call context: pack protocol 2.3.0 adds optional `projectId` and `orgId` to `callContext`. A pack service built with Kindgi 0.1.1 answers such calls as before (it checks only `v`, `tenantId` and `runId`); `@kindgi/pack-conformance` has a suite that proves it against the 0.1.1 releases (`describeCallContextCompatibility`). Also: `NodeContext.projectId` / `orgId` for the kernel, and `InvokeAgentInput.orgId` and `ResumeAgentTurnInput.orgId`, so a turn resumed after an approval keeps its org.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- 610a9de: `@kindgi/agents` uses drizzle-orm 0.45.3, which fixes how SQL identifiers are escaped (GHSA-gpj5-g38j-94v9). Kindgi's schema uses fixed identifiers only, so it wasn't exploitable through Kindgi. `@kindgi/api` no longer depends on drizzle-orm, which it never used.
- a994217: An approval gate keeps its decision when the turn resumes. A turn that parked on a gate decided again on resume, from the policy and conversation as they were by then: a rule relaxed meanwhile skipped the gate, so a reviewer's reject was never read and the tool ran; a turn completed meanwhile changed the session gate's token, so the decision was ignored and the turn parked again.
  
  - `NodeContext.record(key, decide)` (`@kindgi/handler`): decide once per step. The first call journals `decide`'s result; when the step runs again after a wait, the call returns it without deciding again. The journal entry is `value.recorded`, derived into `DerivedRunState.recordedValues` (`@kindgi/runtime`, `recordedValueKey`).
  - `record` is a new required member of `NodeContext`: a test double that builds its own `NodeContext` adds it. A decision outlives a retry of the step as well as a wait; calls for one key at the same time share one decision; the first call returns the JSON the journal keeps, as a replay does.
  - `NodeContext.clockNow` replays as documented: when the step resumes after a wait, its calls return the times they read before, in call order. A retry after a failure reads the clock afresh.
  - The session and tool approval gates (`@kindgi/agents`) decide through `record`. A gate not yet reached follows the policy as it is now.
  - `resumeAgentTurn` reports a snapshot it couldn't read as `run-snapshot-unreadable` (resuming again may work), apart from `run-snapshot-missing`. Both are declared: `RunSnapshotError` in `InvokeAgentError`.
  
  Upgrading: a turn that parked on a gate under an earlier runtime has no recorded decision, so when this runtime resumes it, its gate decides once more from the current policy, as before.

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: `AgentStepOutput` and `agentStepOutput()`: what an agent step in a flow outputs, projected from its turn's `AgentTurnResult`.
  
  - `output`: the parsed answer, when the agent declares `output`.
  - `text`: the final answer's text.
  - `runId` and `conversationId`: the step's turn, a child run of the flow run.
  - `usage`.
  - `violations`: the non-blocking guardrail findings, as `guardrailId`, `severity` and `action`.
  
  Nodes after the step read the typed answer as `nodeOutputs.<step>.output.<field>`.
- aec851d: Fallback providers. `ProviderMetadata.fallback: true` makes a provider serve a capability only when no other provider satisfies it; `route()` then reports `fallback: true`, and a fallback is never an alternate to a regular pick. An agent turn routed to one carries a `fallback-provider` warning (`AgentTurnResult.warnings`). `dev-echo` is a fallback, so registering a real model takes over from it with nothing to switch off — before, ties went to the provider id that sorts first, and `dev-echo` beat `gemini`, `groq` or `ollama`. `POST /v1/providers` accepts and returns `fallback`; the clients carry it. The providers and getting-started skills describe it, and register Anthropic or Gemini with `kindgi providers register --preset` (the CLI's presets).
- aec851d: A pack service to run a pack's code over HTTP (pack protocol v2), and tools learn which run they belong to.
  
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`:
    - New `./protocol` (v2): tool and check requests name the tool or check by id, and responses are `result`, `check-result` or `error` messages with typed codes (including `tool-not-in-pack`, `tool-version-mismatch`, `deadline-exceeded` and `cancelled`).
    - New `./pack-service`: `createPackService` and `startPackService` expose `POST /v1/invoke`, `GET /v1/info`, `/healthz` and `/readyz`, with token auth, a concurrency cap, a body limit, deadlines, cancellation on disconnect, prewarm and drain.
    - New `./pack-service-main`: the process entry (`KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `KINDGI_PACK_INDEX`, `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, `PORT`; SIGTERM drains).
    - `HandlerContext.abortSignal` (in-process calls only) lets handlers stop on cancel or deadline.
    - The v1 worker, controller and invokers are unchanged.
  - `@kindgi/tools`: `ToolContext.runId`, the kernel run a call belongs to. `requestId` stays the individual call's id.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: agent tool calls set `runId` to the turn's kernel run. They used to pass only the model's call id.
- aec851d: A tenant can hold every agent to its own approval rules: a new policy kind, `hitl`.
  
  - `@kindgi/policy-contract`:
    - **The kind.** `hitl` joins `POLICY_KINDS`. Its spec, `HitlSpec` (`{ maxTimeoutMs?, minReviewerRole?, tools? }`), only tightens an agent's own approval rules: the shorter timeout, the higher reviewer role, and per tool id the stricter gate. `tools` maps a tool id to a mode (`never_ask`, `ask_on_first_use`, `always_ask`) or a rule `{ mode, requiredRole? }`.
    - **Exports.** `HitlSpec`, `ToolHitlMode`, `ToolHitlRule`, `ReviewerRole`, `TOOL_HITL_MODES`, `REVIEWER_ROLES`, `validateHitlSpec`, `combineHitlSpecs` (one spec at least as strict as each), and the helpers `toolHitlRule`, `stricterToolHitlRule`, `higherRole`.
    - **`validatePolicySpec(kind, spec)`** checks a spec against its kind's contract, for `tool-errors` and `hitl`. Other kinds pass.
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Applied per turn.** A turn resolves its approval rules once, at `setup` (and again when it resumes): the agent's `conversationPolicy.hitl`, held to the tenant's `hitl` policy through `policyRegistry`. Each tool call is gated by the stricter of the agent's rule for that tool and the tenant's.
    - **Fails closed.** When the tenant's `hitl` policy can't be evaluated, the turn fails with the new `tenant-policy-unavailable` error (`TenantPolicyUnavailableError`, which carries `policyKind`). Running without the policy would skip the tenant's approvals. No `hitl` executor bound means no tenant policy, as before.
    - **Breaking (preview):** `resolveEffectiveHitlPolicy({ tenant, agent })` takes the tenant's `HitlSpec` or `undefined`. `TenantHitlPolicy` is removed. `EffectiveHitlPolicy` gains `toolFloors`. An agent's tool modes and rules use `@kindgi/policy-contract`'s `ToolHitlMode` and `ToolHitlRule`, unchanged in shape.
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - **Checked when written.** `POST /v1/policies` refuses a `tool-errors` or `hitl` spec that breaks its contract, with `validation-failed`. Each issue is pathed under `spec`, e.g. `spec/tools/acme.pay/mode`. Before, such a spec was stored and only found out on a turn.
    - **Status.** `tenant-policy-unavailable` maps to 503. `PolicyKind` includes `hitl`.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `PolicyKind` includes `hitl`. The Python client's models do too.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the agents skills (TypeScript and Python) say a tenant's `hitl` policy can tighten an agent's gates, never loosen them.
- aec851d: Failed tool calls go back to the model to correct, under a policy.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Retries.** When a tool call fails, the failure goes back to the model as the call's result (what failed, the validation issues, what to do), and the turn continues. A failure the policy doesn't retry, or one past its retries, fails the turn as before.
    - **The setting.** `Agent.toolErrors` (`{ maxRetries?, retryOn? }`) sets how many failed calls go back per turn and for which kinds. Default: one retry, for `invalid-arguments` and `unknown-tool`, where nothing ran. `tool-error` (a tool that ran and failed) is opt-in.
    - **Bounds.** Each retry costs a step against `budget.maxSteps`. Retries are counted from the turn's messages, so a replayed turn counts the same.
    - **Errors.** `tool-invocation-failed` and `unresolved-tool` carry `toolRetries` when retries ran out.
    - **Exports.** `DEFAULT_TOOL_ERRORS` and `effectiveToolErrorPolicy`. A rejected HITL tool approval writes its result through the same path as a retry.
  - `@kindgi/policy-contract`:
    - A new policy kind, `tool-errors`. It caps an agent's setting, like every tenant policy: the fewer retries wins, and only kinds both allow are retried.
    - `ToolErrorsSpec`, `ToolErrorKind`, `TOOL_ERROR_KINDS`, `MAX_TOOL_ERROR_RETRIES` (10), and `validateToolErrorsSpec`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.3.0 adds `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `toolErrors` (`ToolErrorsSpec`). `PolicyKind` derives from `POLICY_KINDS`, so it includes `tool-errors`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `PolicyKind` includes `tool-errors`, and the generated agent types carry `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the agents skill covers `output` and `toolErrors`, and `preferredModel` as `defineAgent` keeps it.
- aec851d: Tool lookups are bound to one tenant: `ToolRegistry.forTenant(tenantId)` replaces `hydrate`.
  
  - `@kindgi/tools`: `ToolRegistry.hydrate?(tenantId): Promise<void>` is replaced by a required `forTenant(tenantId): Promise<ToolRegistry>` that returns a registry answering for that tenant only. With `hydrate` followed by the tenant-less `resolve`, a multi-tenant implementation had to keep a shared "current tenant", so two tenants' concurrent agent turns could resolve each other's tools. `createToolRegistry` (single-tenant) returns itself; `invalidate(tenantId)` is unchanged. Implementations must add `forTenant` (breaking for custom `ToolRegistry` implementations).
  - `@kindgi/agents`: each turn resolves its tools through `toolRegistry.forTenant(tenantId)` (`resolveTurnTools`).
- aec851d: Typed agent output and structured turn input.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Typed output.** An agent can declare `output: { schema, name?, maxRepairs? }` (JSON Schema, or a Zod schema converted by `defineAgent`).
      - The final answer must be JSON matching the schema; a fenced JSON block is accepted.
      - An answer that doesn't fit is sent back to the model with the problems listed, up to `maxRepairs` times (default 1, counted against `budget.maxSteps`). After that the turn fails with `output-schema-violation` (`errors`, `attempts`).
      - The parsed answer is `AgentTurnResult.output`, or `null` on a dry run, where no answer is checked.
    - `AgentTurnResult.runId` is the turn's kernel run.
    - **Structured input.** `invokeAgent({ input })` makes `{{ input.* }}` available to the instructions (`input` joins `AUTO_INJECTED_VARS`). It is kept in the run snapshot and passed to guardrails as `trace.attributes.stepInput`.
    - **Parent link.** `invokeAgent({ parent })` records the run that started the turn, for turns started by a flow step.
    - **Resume.** The run snapshot keeps `parameters` and `input`, and `resumeAgentTurn` restores them; a resumed turn used to lose its parameters. Migration `0002` adds the two columns to `agent_run_snapshots`.
    - **Guardrail trace.** `buildRunTrace` now takes the run id, project id, turn number and user message. The trace carries them, so failed checks during a turn produce compliance evidence. Before, `runId` was the conversation id, `turnCount` was the step count, and `projectId` was missing. `attributes.steps` replaces `attributes.turnCount`; a typed answer appears as `attributes.structuredOutput`.
    - `defineAgent` keeps `preferredModel`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.2.0 adds `output`, `preferredProvider` and `preferredModel`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `output`, `conversationPolicy`, `preferredModel`, `description` and `tags`.
  - `@kindgi/dev-echo-provider`: a call with no tools gets the last user message back as the answer, instead of a call to an echo tool the agent doesn't have.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `output` (`AgentOutputSpec`); `output-schema-violation` maps to 422.
  - `@kindgi/client`: the generated agent types carry `output`.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: A failed model call says why. The turn's `model-invocation-failed` message names the provider and model and carries the provider's own words — `Model call to anthropic (claude-haiku-4-5) failed: 401 … "API key is invalid."` — instead of only `Model call step "invoke" failed` (the detail was in `cause`, which callers don't show). The cause text is one line, at most 500 characters.
- aec851d: The pack service is the only way pack code runs. The old run-queue controller and the stdio worker are removed.
  
  - **Breaking (preview), `@kindgi/handler-runtime`:**
    - **Removed:**
      - the run-queue controller (`managed-run-controller`) and its run fetchers (`HttpFetcher`, `InMemoryFetcher`);
      - the per-call sandbox invokers (`tool-sandbox-invoker`, `check-sandbox-invoker`);
      - the version-1 stdio worker protocol: its frames, `encodeFrame`, `parseStdinFrame(s)`, `runWorkerStdio`, the worker's `main` and `PROTOCOL_VERSION`.
  
      None of these had a caller. A pack image now runs the pack service, which replaced them.
    - **Removed exports:** `./managed-run-controller`, `./managed-run-worker`, `./fetchers/http`, `./fetchers/in-memory`, `./tool-sandbox-invoker` and `./check-sandbox-invoker`, and their names on the package root.
    - **The handler runner:**
      - `runWorker` is now `runHandler` (`RunHandlerOptions`), and the check runner is `runCheck` (`RunCheckOptions`), both exported from the package root. They're unchanged apart from the names.
      - `HandlerErrorCode` drops the four stdio-only codes (`malformed-stdin-frame`, `unknown-envelope-version`, `unexpected-frame-kind`, `stdin-closed`).
  - **Fix: a guardrail check in the pack service gets the call's abort signal.** `runCheck` takes `abortSignal` and passes it as `bindings.abortSignal`, and the pack service passes its call's signal, which fires on the deadline or when the caller disconnects. Before, a check got empty bindings and kept running after its call ended.
  - `@kindgi/agents`, `@kindgi/sdk`: comments and a skill's sources name the handler runner.
- aec851d: Safety fixes in model routing policy and the agent turn.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`: combining the bound tenant policy with a policy derived from the registry now yields a policy at least as strict as each. Allow lists (`providers.allow`, `models.allow`, `regionAllow`) intersect when both set one; they were unioned, so a registry policy could widen what the tenant allowed (for example an `eu-west-1`-only tenant also allowing `us-east-1`). Deny lists still union; caps take the smaller value.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: guardrails now run on the final response before it is stored. A response that a blocking guardrail rejects is no longer written to the conversation (and no final `agent.message` event is emitted for it); the turn fails with `guardrail-violation` as before. The agent-turn flow is now version `1.1.0` (`evaluate-guardrails` → `persist-final-message`); runs parked on the `1.0.0` flow cannot be resumed.
  - `@kindgi/capabilities`: a tenant allow list that is present restricts routing even when empty — `[]` allows nothing (fail closed), as a capability requirement's allow list already did. Previously an empty tenant allow list meant "no restriction".
- aec851d: A turn parked on a tool-call approval resumes where it parked.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Fix: `resumeAgentTurn` after a tool-call approval.** It used to fail with `model-invocation-failed` ("model-call invoked before setup completed"), because the steps that ran before the park kept their state in memory. The turn now rebuilds that state:
      - its environment (conversation, guardrails, tools, policies), routed to the provider and model the turn started on. If that provider or model is no longer registered or allowed, the resume fails with `capability-routing-failed`.
      - the messages the turn stored, its retrieved facts, and its usage, so budgets count the whole turn.
    - **No repeats.** The step that parked runs again. It reuses the assistant message and the results of calls that ran before the park, so no call runs twice and nothing is stored twice.
    - **Errors.** `run-journal-unavailable` when the run's journal can't be read.
    - **Not rebuilt: provenance.** Provenance recorded before the park isn't rebuilt; the resumed turn's record starts at the resume.
  - `@kindgi/runtime`:
    - `DerivedRunState.completedBodySteps`: the loop-body steps that completed, by `bodyStepKey(nodeId, loopContext)`. A runtime replaying a loop on resume hands those steps their journaled results instead of running them again.
    - `CompletedBodyStep` and `bodyStepKey`.
- aec851d: Guardrail checks stop when the turn does.
  
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: `EvaluationBindings.abortSignal` (optional). It fires when the caller stops waiting: the agent turn was cancelled, or ran past its wall-clock budget. The llm-judge strategy passes it to the judge's model call. A check that calls out to a model or a service should pass it on.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: the turn's abort signal reaches every guardrail check. `evaluateGate` takes it as a fifth argument. Before, a slow or stuck judge, or a pack check, held the turn past its budget.
- aec851d: A run blocked by a guardrail now says which one, and clients get it as a typed error.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`: the `guardrail-violation` message (and the `turn.failed` event's) names each blocking guardrail with its check's reason — `Turn blocked by guardrail 'no-pii': Response contains an email` — instead of only counting them.
  - `@kindgi/client` (re-exported by `@kindgi/sdk`): new `GuardrailViolationError` variant of `KindgiError` (`code: 'guardrail-violation'`, `violations[]` with `guardrailId` / `severity` / `action` / `reason?`, `evaluationErrors[]`). `fromWire()` previously returned it as a generic `ServerError`. Exhaustive `switch (err.code)` statements need the new case.
  - `@kindgi/api`: `POST /v1/runs` sends a binding failure's `details` as the wire error's `details`; they were nested under `details.details`, so clients could not read them.
- aec851d: Messages and variable descriptions no longer point at internal components: `KINDGI_API_PORT` / `KINDGI_OPENFGA_API_URL` / `KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND` descriptions say what the runtime does; the `external` guardrail strategy's error says to register an execution strategy; the payload-version error reads "Unsupported payload version N (this reader handles version M)" — it was worded "newer than this reader" also for older versions.
- aec851d: LLM-judge guardrails route under the tenant policy.
  
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: `EvaluationBindings.tenantPolicy`. When set, the judge model is routed under it (provider / model allow and deny lists, `regionAllow`, caps), and an explicit `judgeProvider` must satisfy it too — otherwise the check fails with `judge-routing-failed`. Previously judges were routed with no tenant policy, so a tenant restricted to one region could have its run output sent to a judge model elsewhere.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: the turn passes the tenant policy it was routed under (bound policy merged with the policy registry's) to guardrail evaluation; `evaluateGate` takes it as an optional fourth argument.
- aec851d: Two error messages (`invokeAgent` without `bindings.runBinding`; provenance `emit` without an `emitBinding`) now say which binding to pass instead of naming a runtime-internal factory.
- aec851d: Tool inputs get their Zod defaults, transforms and refinements.
  
  - `@kindgi/schema`:
    - `toJSONSchema(schema, io)` and `toJSONSchemaSync(schema, converter, io)` take a required `io` (`SchemaIo`, `'input'` or `'output'`). The two sides differ exactly where Zod defaults: on the input side a `.default()` field is optional, on the output side it is required. Before, every conversion produced the output side.
    - `parseWithSchema(schema, value)` parses through a Zod schema's Standard Schema interface: defaults, transforms and refinements applied, or the issues.
  - `@kindgi/tools`:
    - A tool's advertised input schema is the input side, so a model may leave a defaulted field out.
    - `invokeTool` validates a copy of the input, filling in JSON Schema `default`s. A Zod-authored tool's input is then parsed with `inputZod`, so the handler gets its parsed input. A failed refinement is `input-validation-failed`, with the field's path.
    - A handler's input type defaults to `InferOutput` of the input schema, the parsed type.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: `runWorker`, which the pack service runs tools through, prepares the input the same way. The indexer converts tool inputs and guardrail config on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: a check's config schema converts on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: a typed agent's output schema converts on the output side, so downstream steps can rely on every field.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the tools skill explains what a handler receives.
