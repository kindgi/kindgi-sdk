## 0.1.4-rc.1

### Patch Changes

- 0359caf: **Data blocks: a settings schema holds for every later version, and a repeated derive returns the version that has it.**
  
  - **A settings version that gives no `schema` keeps the latest version's.** The runtime stores it on the new version, so it's checked on every later version, not just the next one. A version that gives a schema replaces it, and is checked against that schema only. `{}` drops the check on purpose. Before, one edit that didn't restate the schema dropped it for good.
  - **`POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/versions` with a swap an active version already holds** returns that version unchanged (`200`), instead of numbering a duplicate. That covers the same swap derived again, or a deploy that registered it.
  - **Errors:**
    - Publishing an agent that can't be pinned says "uses tool or data-block versions it can't pin" (it said "tool versions", even for a block issue).
    - A template's unresolved settings block is named in full: `settings.acme.reply-style`, not `settings.acme.reply`.

## 0.1.4-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- c313224: **An agent version is pinned when it's published.** `POST /v1/agents` resolves each of the agent's tool ranges once, to the highest active version the range allows (`pickVersion`). It stores the result on the version as `pins` (`{tools, prompts, settings}`: tool id → exact version) with `pinsDigest` (`sha256:<hex>` of the pins' canonical JSON). Every run of that version uses exactly those tool versions. A new tool version reaches the agent only through a new agent version, and two runs of one agent version always run the same tools.
  
  - **A range that matches no published version refuses the publish:** `400 validation-failed`, with one issue per tool (`/tools/<i>/version`, "publish the tool first").
  - **Pins are set by the runtime, never authored.** `defineAgent` doesn't take them, and a publish body's `pins` is ignored.
  - **`GET /v1/agents/:id/versions/:version` returns `pins` and `pinsDigest`**, as do both clients. Python adds `pins_digest()` in `kindgi.client`, which gives the same string as `pinsDigest()` in `@kindgi/agents`.
  - **Unchanged:** a version published before pins, or by a runtime without a tool registry, has no pins and resolves its ranges per run. `agentsRouter` takes the tool binding as an optional third argument, and `createApp` passes its `toolRegistry`.
- 024a47f: **An agent's prompt and settings can come from data blocks, pinned when the agent version is published.**
  
  - **References:**
    - `instructions` is the system prompt, or a prompt block by range: `{ prompt: 'acme.intake-prompt', version: '^1.0.0' }`. Its template and declared parameters are used instead.
    - `settings: [{ id, version }]` lists settings blocks.
    - `modelSettings: { id, version }` names a model-settings block (`MODEL_SETTINGS_SCHEMA`: `temperature`, `maxOutputTokens`).
  - **Pinned at publish:** `POST /v1/agents` and deploys resolve each reference by `pickVersion` into `pins.prompts` / `pins.settings`, alongside the tools.
  - **Refusals:** a reference that matches no published version, names a block of the other kind, names model settings that aren't, or runs on a runtime with no block registry refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`).
  - **At run time:** a turn loads each block at its pinned version. A resumed turn uses the versions its `setup` journaled (`blockVersions`).
    - The prompt block renders as the instructions.
    - Settings values reach tools as `ToolContext.settings['<id>']` and templates as `settings["<id>"]`.
    - Model settings go into the model call.
    - A block that can't load fails the turn (`block-unresolvable`).
    - `InvokeAgentBindings` takes an optional `blockReader`.
  - **Changed elsewhere:** the agent spec, the pack index, both indexers (TS and Python: `Agent(instructions={...}, settings=[...], model_settings={...})`), and both clients.
  - **Pack protocol 2.4.0:** `callContext` gets optional `settings`, so pack code reads them: `ctx.settings['acme.weights']` in TS, `ctx.settings["acme.weights"]` in Python. Older pack services still answer calls that carry it: a TS one passes it to the handler, a Python one drops it.
  - **`settings` is now a reserved template name.**
- a0652ac: **Data blocks: versioned prompts and settings an agent version will pin.** A block is published like a tool: immutable versions, soft unregister and reinstate. It belongs to one project.
  
  - **Kinds:**
    - `prompt`: a Liquid template with declared parameters, rendered as an agent's instructions are.
    - `settings`: a JSON object, optionally with a JSON Schema. Its values must satisfy it, and so must a later version's.
  - **`@kindgi/api` adds `/v1/blocks`:** list (latest of each; `kind`, `name`, `projectId` filters), get, versions (`includeTombstoned`), a version, publish, unregister and reinstate. It's mounted when `createApp` gets a `blockRegistry` (`BlockRegistryBinding`).
  - **Authorization goes through the block's project:** `read` to read, `write` to publish, unregister or reinstate. A block the caller can't read answers 404.
  - **Refusals:**
    - a block's kind never changes;
    - a block's versions stay in its first version's project (`409 block-project-mismatch`);
    - a taken version is `409 block-already-registered`.
  - **`@kindgi/agents` adds** `validateBlock()`, `settingsSchemaIssues()` and the block types.
  - **Clients:** `@kindgi/client` adds `client.blocks`, and the Python client has the same resource.
  - **`@kindgi/cli` adds** `kindgi blocks list | show | versions | publish | unregister | reinstate`. `publish` takes `--prompt=@<file>`, `--settings=<json>|@<file>` with `--schema`, or a full definition as JSON.
- fa6680c: **A deploy pins its agents and never keeps a version's old pins.** `POST /v1/deployments` pins each agent as `POST /v1/agents` does. A deploy registers an agent under the version its definition names. When that version is already registered with other pins or content (versions never change), the deploy registers the next free version in its line instead (`1.4.0` → `1.4.1`, `1.4.0-rc.1` → `1.4.0-rc.2`). A deploy never refuses a routine deploy over this.
  
  - **Why a new version:**
    - `pins-changed`: a tool the agent uses has a new version in range.
    - `unpinned`: the version was published before pins existed.
    - `version-taken`: the number is registered with another definition.
  - **Redeploys are idempotent.** A redeploy finds the version an earlier deploy registered for the same definition and pins.
  - **The record:**
    - The registered version records `derivedFrom: {version, reason}`.
    - The deployment's `contents.agents` names each agent's registered `version`. Where it differs from the definition's, it also gives `authoredVersion`, `reason`, `newVersion` and `pinChanges`.
  - **`kindgi deploy` prints one line per such agent:** `agent acme.matcher: registered new version 1.4.1 (1.4.0's pins changed: tool acme.score 1.0.0 → 1.1.0); set version: '1.4.1' in acme.matcher to match`.
  - **A range that matches no published version refuses the deploy:** `400 validation-failed`, with one issue per tool (`/agents/<i>/tools/<j>/version`), and the deploy's tools are rolled back.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `pinChanges()` and the `AgentDerivation` and `PinChange` types.
    - `@kindgi/tools`: `nextVersion()`.
- 26b2a23: **A flow version is pinned when it's published, as an agent version is.** `POST /v1/flows` pins each tool the flow runs to its latest active version: tool nodes, fanout branches, and nodes in loop bodies. It also pins each agent the flow runs at no named version (an agent node without `config.version`). The result is stored on the version as `pins` (`{tools, agents}`) with `pinsDigest`, and every run of that flow version uses those versions. A new tool or agent version reaches the flow only through a new flow version. An agent node with its own `config.version` keeps it.
  
  - **Refusals:** a tool or agent with no published version refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`, naming each).
  - **Deploys** pin flows after agents and follow the same rule as agents, from one shared code path. When pins change, the deploy registers the next free version with `derivedFrom`, and a redeploy is idempotent. So one tool change cascades through an agent into a flow within a single deploy, each derived once. The deployment's `contents.flows` names each flow's registered version (`DeployedVersion`), and `kindgi deploy` prints one line per renumbered flow.
  - **Unchanged:** a flow version published before pins binds the latest versions per run, as before.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/flow`: `FlowPins`, `flowPinsDigest()` and `flowRefs()`.
    - `@kindgi/types`: `VersionDerivation`.
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `PinChange.kind` adds `agent`, and `pinChanges()` takes any pin set. `withVersions(flow, { tools?, agents? })` (`@kindgi/flow`) runs a flow version with some blocks at other exact versions through the same pins: what a comparison or replay runs, with `pinsDigest` recomputed.
- d0ebeb6: Replay turns: an agent turn can re-run a past run for an eval run without doing anything the past run didn't do.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - `InvokeAgentInput.replay` (`{ of, evalRunId }`) marks a turn as a replay. It is kept on the turn's run and in its run snapshot (new nullable `agent_run_snapshots.replay` column), so a resumed turn stays a replay.
    - The new optional `InvokeAgentBindings.replay` (`ReplayBinding`) decides each tool call:
      - `live`: the tool runs;
      - `recorded`: the past run's result is used;
      - `refused`: the model gets the given result.
    - Whatever the binding says, only a tool declared read-only (`mutating: false`, no writing effect, see `isReadOnlyTool`) with no approval to wait for runs. A replay with no binding refuses every call.
    - Each decision is journaled, and `AgentTurnResult.replay` lists them. A refused call shows what the turn would have done.
    - `retrievals` can supply the past run's retrieved facts. `sessionApproval` gives the past run's decision at the session approval gate, which the replay follows (a recorded rejection fails the turn with `hitl-rejected`). Without a recorded decision the gate is skipped, and the result says so.
    - `tool.completed` events carry `replay: 'live' | 'recorded' | 'refused'`.
  - `@kindgi/runtime`: `RunReplayRef`; `replay` on `runGraph` and `startRun`; `replayOf` and `evalRunId` on `KernelRunRecord`; `replays` and `evalRunId` on `ListRunsInput`.
  - `@kindgi/capabilities`: `ModelUsageRecord.replay` tags a replay's model calls with the past run and the eval run.
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - A run carries `replayOf` and `evalRunId`.
    - `GET /v1/runs` leaves replay runs out unless `replays=include|only`; `evalRunId` lists one eval run's replays.
    - A judged agent turn's captured `context` also keeps `sessionApproval`, the decision at its session approval gate.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `runs.list({ replays, evalRunId })`; the Python client too.
  - `@kindgi/cli`: `kindgi runs list --replays=<exclude|include|only> --eval-run=<id>`.
- a5560d7: A resumed agent turn runs the tool versions it started with. `setup` journals the version each tool reference resolved to (`toolVersions`), and a turn resumed after a pause (an approval) resolves exactly those, instead of its version ranges again: a tool version published while the turn waited no longer runs mid-turn. A version that's gone fails the turn with `tool-version-unresolvable` ("this turn started with version …") rather than running another. A turn whose journal predates `toolVersions` resolves its ranges, as before.
- 62608e3: **Unregister stops a version being chosen, not the pins that hold it.**
  
  - **Retired tool versions.** `createToolRegistry().register(tool, { retired: true })` keeps an unregistered tool version for the published agent and flow versions that pin it.
    - Only its exact version (`getVersion`, `hasVersion`) reaches it.
    - `resolve` (a range), `get` (latest), `list`, `versions`, `has` and `ids` skip it.
  - **A pinned turn reaches it.** A turn resolves a pinned tool by its exact version, so a published agent version pinned to a retired tool version keeps running it. A range never picks one.
  - **`getVersion` reads unregistered versions.** `AgentRegistryBinding.getVersion` and `FlowRegistryBinding.getVersion` return them too (`AgentVersionRecord`, `FlowVersionRecord`, with `unregisteredAt`). `GET /v1/agents/:id/versions/:version` and `GET /v1/flows/:id/versions/:version` return `unregisteredAt`.
  - **Who reads what:** a resumed run, provenance, and a flow version that pins an agent version read unregistered versions. A new run that names one is refused by the runtime.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 2544717: An approval says who decided it, after the decision: on the API, in the run's journal, and in the turn's provenance.
  
  - **API.** `GET /v1/approvals/:id` and `GET /v1/approvals` carry an approval's recorded `decision` (`ApprovalDecisionRecord`): `decision`, `rationale`, `reviewerId`, `reviewerRoleAtDecision`, `decidedAt` and `decidedBy`, the decider as an actor, `user:<userId>`. An open approval, or one that ended without a decision (expired, or escalated by a timeout), has none. The TypeScript client types it (`Approval.decision`, `ApprovalDecisionRecord`), and the Python client models it.
  - **Journal.** `POST /v1/approvals/:id/complete` resumes the run with `{ decided, rationale?, decidedBy, approvalId }` (`GateDecisionValue`, exported by `@kindgi/agents`), so the run's journal records who decided which approval. `readGateDecision` reads `decidedBy` and `approvalId` when they're there; a value without them still decides. Another subject's explicit `value` is resumed as given.
  - **Provenance.** A tool call that waited on an approval has a `wait` node (`tool-hitl-gate-wait:<invocationId>`, the agent parked, at the time it parked) `resumed-from` a `resume` node (`tool-hitl-gate-resume:<invocationId>`, at the time the decision came; its `actor` is whoever decided, and its attributes the decision, rationale and `approvalId`). The call `waited-on` the wait, and its result was `caused-by` the resume. A resumed turn reads them from its journal, so every call shows its approval, those decided before an earlier park too. The session gate's `resume` node names whoever decided as its `actor` (the agent, for a decision recorded before it was named), with the `approvalId`.
  - **For a custom `HitlBinding`:** return each approval's `decision` from `getApproval` and `listApprovals`, with `ReviewDecisionRecord.decidedBy`, for them to show; both are optional, and a binding without them answers as before.
- 0f226c2: An agent's approval gates fail closed. A tool-call approval rejected with a `value` still ran the tool: `POST /v1/approvals/:id/complete` let a `value` replace the resume payload `{ decided, rationale }`, and the tool and session gates went on unless they read an explicit `reject`. Now only an explicit approve lets a tool run or a session go on; a reject, or an answer that isn't a decision at all, blocks, the tool call with a rejected result that says why. And the route refuses a `value` for an agent's tool-call or session gate (`tool-call:pending`, `agent-turn:session-hitl-gate`) with `400 bad-input`, before anything is recorded; another subject's approval still takes one. `@kindgi/agents` exports the gate subjects (`AGENT_GATE_SUBJECTS`, `TOOL_CALL_GATE_SUBJECT`, `SESSION_GATE_SUBJECT`) and `readGateDecision`.
- 629057d: Every model call is recorded, with everything the provider says about it, and the cost API reads it per call, per run tree, and per org.
  
  - **Usage recording.** The agent turn records each model call in a usage sink (`InvokeAgentBindings.usage`, `UsageSink` / `ModelUsageRecord` in `@kindgi/capabilities`) before the step goes on, a call that threw included. The record carries the call id, project, run, agent and version, conversation, step, provider, the model actually called, a fallback flag, status, usage, duration and finish reason; a failed call's error carries the attempts it took. llm-judge guardrails record theirs too (`EvaluationBindings.usage`, `purpose: guardrail-judge:<id>`, with the turn's step and agent version). A dry run records nothing.
  - **A sink that fails** is tried again (`recordModelUsage`; a record is idempotent by call id). An answered call it still can't record fails the step with `persistence-error` (an llm-judge's is `judge-usage-unrecorded`, which the turn fails on the same way). A failed call keeps its own failure, and says when it couldn't be recorded either.
  - **Usage, unfolded.** `UsageCounters` reports the parts of its totals: `cacheReadTokens` and `cacheWriteTokens` are parts of `promptTokens`, `reasoningTokens` of `completionTokens`. A part is there when the provider reports it, a reported 0 included, and absent when it doesn't. `ModelCallResult` adds `servedModel` (the exact version the vendor reports), `providerRequestId`, `attempts` (HTTP attempts, the SDK's own retries included, counted with `createAttemptCounter` from `@kindgi/capabilities/attempts`, a Node-only entry; a call that throws keeps its own error, and `attemptsOf(error)` gives its attempts) and `rawUsage` (the vendor's usage object as it reported it). The Anthropic, Gemini and OpenAI-compatible adapters fill them.
  - **Breaking, for a custom model adapter:** `UsageCounters.cachedTokens` is renamed `cacheReadTokens`.
  - **Breaking, for a custom `CostBinding`:** `tokens` is required on `CostAggregateGroup` and `CostAggregateResult`, and a binding that can't read should throw (the API answers 500) rather than return an empty page.
  - **Cost API (`@kindgi/api`, `@kindgi/client`).** A cost record of a model call carries `callId`, `projectId`, `rootRunId`, `parentRunId`, `agentVersion`, `flowId`, `nodeId`, `step`, `purpose`, `model`, `servedModel`, `fallback`, `status`, `usage`, `durationMs`, `finishReason`, `providerRequestId`, `attempts` and `error`, and `rawUsage` with `include=rawUsage`. New filters: `model`, `servedModel`, `rootRunId`, `includeDescendants` (with `runId`). New `groupBy` dimensions: `model`, `servedModel`, `projectId`, `orgId`, `rootRunId`, `flowId`. Every aggregate group and the total carry `tokens: {prompt, completion, cacheRead, cacheWrite, reasoning}`. A binding that fails answers 500, never an empty page. `to` is exclusive, as the binding always applied it. The TypeScript client takes `scope`, the new filters and `includeRawUsage`.
  - **`run.finished`** carries `usage: {calls, costUsd, tokens}` (`RunTreeUsage`) for the run tree, when the runtime records usage: what the ledger had recorded when the run finished, failed calls counted (a child run still running then isn't in it).
  - **Clients:** `includeDescendants` is a boolean query parameter; the Python client names a cost record's error `ModelCallError`.
  - **Provenance (breaking for readers of `model-call` attributes):** a `model-call` node keeps the call's identity (`callId`, `providerId`, `model`, `finishReason`, `step`); its `promptTokens`, `completionTokens` and `costUsd` are gone from `attributes`. A provenance read carries them in `callUsage`, by `callId`, from the cost ledger, outside the signed DAG (`ProvenanceBinding.getCallUsage`). A signed export includes `callUsage` as it stood when signed (bundle schema `1.1.0`).
- 786cbde: An agent's `conversationPolicy.hitl.onTimeout` is refused unless it's `'escalate'`. `'auto-approve'` and `'auto-reject'` were accepted and ignored: an approval that times out escalates one reviewer tier, and at `admin` it expires (the turn fails with `hitl-cancelled`), whatever the setting said. `defineAgent` (and an agent registered through the API) now refuses them, saying what happens instead: `hitl.onTimeout 'auto-approve' isn't supported: an approval that times out escalates one reviewer tier, and at admin it expires (the turn fails with hitl-cancelled). Use 'escalate', or leave it out.` The type allows `onTimeout?: 'escalate'`.
- 1463b77: Approvals, conversations and provenance list by project, as runs do. `GET /v1/approvals`, `GET /v1/conversations` and `GET /v1/provenance` take `scopeKind=project|org` + `scopeId`: one project's records, or every project's in an org. A `scopeId` that isn't a UUID is `400 scope-invalid`. The records say their project:
  - an agent's approvals are enqueued in the turn's project (`HitlEnqueueInput.projectId`);
  - a conversation has `projectId`, set by the run that opens it or by `POST /v1/conversations`' new `projectId` (one of the tenant's projects, else `400 bad-input`; omitted, the tenant's Default project, as for a run); `agent_conversations` gets a nullable `project_id` (migration `0003`);
  - a provenance record's list row has `projectId`, which the emitter passes beside the signed document (`ProvenanceEmitBinding.emit(provenance, { projectId })`).
  
  `ListScope` (`@kindgi/types`) is the scope of each binding's list input. TypeScript client: `scope` on `approvals.list`, `conversations.list` and `provenance.query`, and `projectId` on `conversations.open`; the Python client takes `scope_kind` / `scope_id` and `project_id` (regenerated). Records from before this release have no project, so only a list without a scope shows them (nothing is backfilled).
- aa4399f: An agent turn's provenance is whole, whether or not it parked.
  
  - **A turn resumed after a tool-call approval** keeps the nodes of the steps that ran before the park: its user message, its retrievals, each model call, and the tool calls of each completed step. Before, they were lost, and the resumed turn's edges pointed at nodes that weren't there.
  - **Every tool call has its `tool-call` and `tool-result` nodes:** one that ran, one a reviewer rejected, one that failed, and one that ran before a park in the same step.
  - **Each model call is `influenced-by` the tool results it read:** every result of the turn before it. The answer now links the tool output it came from.
- 6bae409: An agent's turn names its agent. The run record of an agent run, and of the turn a flow's agent step starts, carries `agent`: the agent's id, the version that ran and the conversation (`RunAgentRef` in `@kindgi/runtime`, `Run.agent` on the wire, the `RunAgent` schema). `GET /v1/runs?agentId=` lists one agent's turns, at every version; it combines with the scope, `topLevel` and the cursor. The TypeScript client takes `runs.list({ agentId })`; the Python client `runs.list(agent_id=…)`. Turns that ran before this release don't name their agent: they have no `agent` and aren't listed by `agentId`.
- eac7732: A tool knows its run's project and org: `ToolContext.projectId` and `orgId` (Python: `project_id`, `org_id`), and a guardrail check's trace gets `orgId` (`org_id`) next to `projectId`. The runtime sets them from the run and its project, never from the run's input or a model's arguments, so a tool can compare an org or project id in its input with the run's own instead of trusting it. `orgId` is absent when the project has no org. They reach pack code in the call context: pack protocol 2.3.0 adds optional `projectId` and `orgId` to `callContext`. A pack service built with Kindgi 0.1.1 answers such calls as before (it checks only `v`, `tenantId` and `runId`); `@kindgi/pack-conformance` has a suite that proves it against the 0.1.1 releases (`describeCallContextCompatibility`). Also: `NodeContext.projectId` / `orgId` for the kernel, and `InvokeAgentInput.orgId` and `ResumeAgentTurnInput.orgId`, so a turn resumed after an approval keeps its org.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- 610a9de: `@kindgi/agents` uses drizzle-orm 0.45.3, which fixes how SQL identifiers are escaped (GHSA-gpj5-g38j-94v9). Kindgi's schema uses fixed identifiers only, so it wasn't exploitable through Kindgi. `@kindgi/api` no longer depends on drizzle-orm, which it never used.
- a994217: An approval gate keeps its decision when the turn resumes. A turn that parked on a gate decided again on resume, from the policy and conversation as they were by then: a rule relaxed meanwhile skipped the gate, so a reviewer's reject was never read and the tool ran; a turn completed meanwhile changed the session gate's token, so the decision was ignored and the turn parked again.
  
  - `NodeContext.record(key, decide)` (`@kindgi/handler`): decide once per step. The first call journals `decide`'s result; when the step runs again after a wait, the call returns it without deciding again. The journal entry is `value.recorded`, derived into `DerivedRunState.recordedValues` (`@kindgi/runtime`, `recordedValueKey`).
  - `record` is a new required member of `NodeContext`: a test double that builds its own `NodeContext` adds it. A decision outlives a retry of the step as well as a wait; calls for one key at the same time share one decision; the first call returns the JSON the journal keeps, as a replay does.
  - `NodeContext.clockNow` replays as documented: when the step resumes after a wait, its calls return the times they read before, in call order. A retry after a failure reads the clock afresh.
  - The session and tool approval gates (`@kindgi/agents`) decide through `record`. A gate not yet reached follows the policy as it is now.
  - `resumeAgentTurn` reports a snapshot it couldn't read as `run-snapshot-unreadable` (resuming again may work), apart from `run-snapshot-missing`. Both are declared: `RunSnapshotError` in `InvokeAgentError`.
  
  Upgrading: a turn that parked on a gate under an earlier runtime has no recorded decision, so when this runtime resumes it, its gate decides once more from the current policy, as before.

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: `AgentStepOutput` and `agentStepOutput()`: what an agent step in a flow outputs, projected from its turn's `AgentTurnResult`.
  
  - `output`: the parsed answer, when the agent declares `output`.
  - `text`: the final answer's text.
  - `runId` and `conversationId`: the step's turn, a child run of the flow run.
  - `usage`.
  - `violations`: the non-blocking guardrail findings, as `guardrailId`, `severity` and `action`.
  
  Nodes after the step read the typed answer as `nodeOutputs.<step>.output.<field>`.
- aec851d: Fallback providers. `ProviderMetadata.fallback: true` makes a provider serve a capability only when no other provider satisfies it; `route()` then reports `fallback: true`, and a fallback is never an alternate to a regular pick. An agent turn routed to one carries a `fallback-provider` warning (`AgentTurnResult.warnings`). `dev-echo` is a fallback, so registering a real model takes over from it with nothing to switch off — before, ties went to the provider id that sorts first, and `dev-echo` beat `gemini`, `groq` or `ollama`. `POST /v1/providers` accepts and returns `fallback`; the clients carry it. The providers and getting-started skills describe it, and register Anthropic or Gemini with `kindgi providers register --preset` (the CLI's presets).
- aec851d: A pack service to run a pack's code over HTTP (pack protocol v2), and tools learn which run they belong to.
  
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`:
    - New `./protocol` (v2): tool and check requests name the tool or check by id, and responses are `result`, `check-result` or `error` messages with typed codes (including `tool-not-in-pack`, `tool-version-mismatch`, `deadline-exceeded` and `cancelled`).
    - New `./pack-service`: `createPackService` and `startPackService` expose `POST /v1/invoke`, `GET /v1/info`, `/healthz` and `/readyz`, with token auth, a concurrency cap, a body limit, deadlines, cancellation on disconnect, prewarm and drain.
    - New `./pack-service-main`: the process entry (`KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `KINDGI_PACK_INDEX`, `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, `PORT`; SIGTERM drains).
    - `HandlerContext.abortSignal` (in-process calls only) lets handlers stop on cancel or deadline.
    - The v1 worker, controller and invokers are unchanged.
  - `@kindgi/tools`: `ToolContext.runId`, the kernel run a call belongs to. `requestId` stays the individual call's id.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: agent tool calls set `runId` to the turn's kernel run. They used to pass only the model's call id.
- aec851d: A tenant can hold every agent to its own approval rules: a new policy kind, `hitl`.
  
  - `@kindgi/policy-contract`:
    - **The kind.** `hitl` joins `POLICY_KINDS`. Its spec, `HitlSpec` (`{ maxTimeoutMs?, minReviewerRole?, tools? }`), only tightens an agent's own approval rules: the shorter timeout, the higher reviewer role, and per tool id the stricter gate. `tools` maps a tool id to a mode (`never_ask`, `ask_on_first_use`, `always_ask`) or a rule `{ mode, requiredRole? }`.
    - **Exports.** `HitlSpec`, `ToolHitlMode`, `ToolHitlRule`, `ReviewerRole`, `TOOL_HITL_MODES`, `REVIEWER_ROLES`, `validateHitlSpec`, `combineHitlSpecs` (one spec at least as strict as each), and the helpers `toolHitlRule`, `stricterToolHitlRule`, `higherRole`.
    - **`validatePolicySpec(kind, spec)`** checks a spec against its kind's contract, for `tool-errors` and `hitl`. Other kinds pass.
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Applied per turn.** A turn resolves its approval rules once, at `setup` (and again when it resumes): the agent's `conversationPolicy.hitl`, held to the tenant's `hitl` policy through `policyRegistry`. Each tool call is gated by the stricter of the agent's rule for that tool and the tenant's.
    - **Fails closed.** When the tenant's `hitl` policy can't be evaluated, the turn fails with the new `tenant-policy-unavailable` error (`TenantPolicyUnavailableError`, which carries `policyKind`). Running without the policy would skip the tenant's approvals. No `hitl` executor bound means no tenant policy, as before.
    - **Breaking (preview):** `resolveEffectiveHitlPolicy({ tenant, agent })` takes the tenant's `HitlSpec` or `undefined`. `TenantHitlPolicy` is removed. `EffectiveHitlPolicy` gains `toolFloors`. An agent's tool modes and rules use `@kindgi/policy-contract`'s `ToolHitlMode` and `ToolHitlRule`, unchanged in shape.
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - **Checked when written.** `POST /v1/policies` refuses a `tool-errors` or `hitl` spec that breaks its contract, with `validation-failed`. Each issue is pathed under `spec`, e.g. `spec/tools/acme.pay/mode`. Before, such a spec was stored and only found out on a turn.
    - **Status.** `tenant-policy-unavailable` maps to 503. `PolicyKind` includes `hitl`.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `PolicyKind` includes `hitl`. The Python client's models do too.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the agents skills (TypeScript and Python) say a tenant's `hitl` policy can tighten an agent's gates, never loosen them.
- aec851d: Failed tool calls go back to the model to correct, under a policy.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Retries.** When a tool call fails, the failure goes back to the model as the call's result (what failed, the validation issues, what to do), and the turn continues. A failure the policy doesn't retry, or one past its retries, fails the turn as before.
    - **The setting.** `Agent.toolErrors` (`{ maxRetries?, retryOn? }`) sets how many failed calls go back per turn and for which kinds. Default: one retry, for `invalid-arguments` and `unknown-tool`, where nothing ran. `tool-error` (a tool that ran and failed) is opt-in.
    - **Bounds.** Each retry costs a step against `budget.maxSteps`. Retries are counted from the turn's messages, so a replayed turn counts the same.
    - **Errors.** `tool-invocation-failed` and `unresolved-tool` carry `toolRetries` when retries ran out.
    - **Exports.** `DEFAULT_TOOL_ERRORS` and `effectiveToolErrorPolicy`. A rejected HITL tool approval writes its result through the same path as a retry.
  - `@kindgi/policy-contract`:
    - A new policy kind, `tool-errors`. It caps an agent's setting, like every tenant policy: the fewer retries wins, and only kinds both allow are retried.
    - `ToolErrorsSpec`, `ToolErrorKind`, `TOOL_ERROR_KINDS`, `MAX_TOOL_ERROR_RETRIES` (10), and `validateToolErrorsSpec`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.3.0 adds `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `toolErrors` (`ToolErrorsSpec`). `PolicyKind` derives from `POLICY_KINDS`, so it includes `tool-errors`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `PolicyKind` includes `tool-errors`, and the generated agent types carry `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the agents skill covers `output` and `toolErrors`, and `preferredModel` as `defineAgent` keeps it.
- aec851d: Tool lookups are bound to one tenant: `ToolRegistry.forTenant(tenantId)` replaces `hydrate`.
  
  - `@kindgi/tools`: `ToolRegistry.hydrate?(tenantId): Promise<void>` is replaced by a required `forTenant(tenantId): Promise<ToolRegistry>` that returns a registry answering for that tenant only. With `hydrate` followed by the tenant-less `resolve`, a multi-tenant implementation had to keep a shared "current tenant", so two tenants' concurrent agent turns could resolve each other's tools. `createToolRegistry` (single-tenant) returns itself; `invalidate(tenantId)` is unchanged. Implementations must add `forTenant` (breaking for custom `ToolRegistry` implementations).
  - `@kindgi/agents`: each turn resolves its tools through `toolRegistry.forTenant(tenantId)` (`resolveTurnTools`).
- aec851d: Typed agent output and structured turn input.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Typed output.** An agent can declare `output: { schema, name?, maxRepairs? }` (JSON Schema, or a Zod schema converted by `defineAgent`).
      - The final answer must be JSON matching the schema; a fenced JSON block is accepted.
      - An answer that doesn't fit is sent back to the model with the problems listed, up to `maxRepairs` times (default 1, counted against `budget.maxSteps`). After that the turn fails with `output-schema-violation` (`errors`, `attempts`).
      - The parsed answer is `AgentTurnResult.output`, or `null` on a dry run, where no answer is checked.
    - `AgentTurnResult.runId` is the turn's kernel run.
    - **Structured input.** `invokeAgent({ input })` makes `{{ input.* }}` available to the instructions (`input` joins `AUTO_INJECTED_VARS`). It is kept in the run snapshot and passed to guardrails as `trace.attributes.stepInput`.
    - **Parent link.** `invokeAgent({ parent })` records the run that started the turn, for turns started by a flow step.
    - **Resume.** The run snapshot keeps `parameters` and `input`, and `resumeAgentTurn` restores them; a resumed turn used to lose its parameters. Migration `0002` adds the two columns to `agent_run_snapshots`.
    - **Guardrail trace.** `buildRunTrace` now takes the run id, project id, turn number and user message. The trace carries them, so failed checks during a turn produce compliance evidence. Before, `runId` was the conversation id, `turnCount` was the step count, and `projectId` was missing. `attributes.steps` replaces `attributes.turnCount`; a typed answer appears as `attributes.structuredOutput`.
    - `defineAgent` keeps `preferredModel`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.2.0 adds `output`, `preferredProvider` and `preferredModel`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `output`, `conversationPolicy`, `preferredModel`, `description` and `tags`.
  - `@kindgi/dev-echo-provider`: a call with no tools gets the last user message back as the answer, instead of a call to an echo tool the agent doesn't have.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `output` (`AgentOutputSpec`); `output-schema-violation` maps to 422.
  - `@kindgi/client`: the generated agent types carry `output`.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: A failed model call says why. The turn's `model-invocation-failed` message names the provider and model and carries the provider's own words — `Model call to anthropic (claude-haiku-4-5) failed: 401 … "API key is invalid."` — instead of only `Model call step "invoke" failed` (the detail was in `cause`, which callers don't show). The cause text is one line, at most 500 characters.
- aec851d: The pack service is the only way pack code runs. The old run-queue controller and the stdio worker are removed.
  
  - **Breaking (preview), `@kindgi/handler-runtime`:**
    - **Removed:**
      - the run-queue controller (`managed-run-controller`) and its run fetchers (`HttpFetcher`, `InMemoryFetcher`);
      - the per-call sandbox invokers (`tool-sandbox-invoker`, `check-sandbox-invoker`);
      - the version-1 stdio worker protocol: its frames, `encodeFrame`, `parseStdinFrame(s)`, `runWorkerStdio`, the worker's `main` and `PROTOCOL_VERSION`.
  
      None of these had a caller. A pack image now runs the pack service, which replaced them.
    - **Removed exports:** `./managed-run-controller`, `./managed-run-worker`, `./fetchers/http`, `./fetchers/in-memory`, `./tool-sandbox-invoker` and `./check-sandbox-invoker`, and their names on the package root.
    - **The handler runner:**
      - `runWorker` is now `runHandler` (`RunHandlerOptions`), and the check runner is `runCheck` (`RunCheckOptions`), both exported from the package root. They're unchanged apart from the names.
      - `HandlerErrorCode` drops the four stdio-only codes (`malformed-stdin-frame`, `unknown-envelope-version`, `unexpected-frame-kind`, `stdin-closed`).
  - **Fix: a guardrail check in the pack service gets the call's abort signal.** `runCheck` takes `abortSignal` and passes it as `bindings.abortSignal`, and the pack service passes its call's signal, which fires on the deadline or when the caller disconnects. Before, a check got empty bindings and kept running after its call ended.
  - `@kindgi/agents`, `@kindgi/sdk`: comments and a skill's sources name the handler runner.
- aec851d: Safety fixes in model routing policy and the agent turn.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`: combining the bound tenant policy with a policy derived from the registry now yields a policy at least as strict as each. Allow lists (`providers.allow`, `models.allow`, `regionAllow`) intersect when both set one; they were unioned, so a registry policy could widen what the tenant allowed (for example an `eu-west-1`-only tenant also allowing `us-east-1`). Deny lists still union; caps take the smaller value.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: guardrails now run on the final response before it is stored. A response that a blocking guardrail rejects is no longer written to the conversation (and no final `agent.message` event is emitted for it); the turn fails with `guardrail-violation` as before. The agent-turn flow is now version `1.1.0` (`evaluate-guardrails` → `persist-final-message`); runs parked on the `1.0.0` flow cannot be resumed.
  - `@kindgi/capabilities`: a tenant allow list that is present restricts routing even when empty — `[]` allows nothing (fail closed), as a capability requirement's allow list already did. Previously an empty tenant allow list meant "no restriction".
- aec851d: A turn parked on a tool-call approval resumes where it parked.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Fix: `resumeAgentTurn` after a tool-call approval.** It used to fail with `model-invocation-failed` ("model-call invoked before setup completed"), because the steps that ran before the park kept their state in memory. The turn now rebuilds that state:
      - its environment (conversation, guardrails, tools, policies), routed to the provider and model the turn started on. If that provider or model is no longer registered or allowed, the resume fails with `capability-routing-failed`.
      - the messages the turn stored, its retrieved facts, and its usage, so budgets count the whole turn.
    - **No repeats.** The step that parked runs again. It reuses the assistant message and the results of calls that ran before the park, so no call runs twice and nothing is stored twice.
    - **Errors.** `run-journal-unavailable` when the run's journal can't be read.
    - **Not rebuilt: provenance.** Provenance recorded before the park isn't rebuilt; the resumed turn's record starts at the resume.
  - `@kindgi/runtime`:
    - `DerivedRunState.completedBodySteps`: the loop-body steps that completed, by `bodyStepKey(nodeId, loopContext)`. A runtime replaying a loop on resume hands those steps their journaled results instead of running them again.
    - `CompletedBodyStep` and `bodyStepKey`.
- aec851d: Guardrail checks stop when the turn does.
  
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: `EvaluationBindings.abortSignal` (optional). It fires when the caller stops waiting: the agent turn was cancelled, or ran past its wall-clock budget. The llm-judge strategy passes it to the judge's model call. A check that calls out to a model or a service should pass it on.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: the turn's abort signal reaches every guardrail check. `evaluateGate` takes it as a fifth argument. Before, a slow or stuck judge, or a pack check, held the turn past its budget.
- aec851d: A run blocked by a guardrail now says which one, and clients get it as a typed error.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`: the `guardrail-violation` message (and the `turn.failed` event's) names each blocking guardrail with its check's reason — `Turn blocked by guardrail 'no-pii': Response contains an email` — instead of only counting them.
  - `@kindgi/client` (re-exported by `@kindgi/sdk`): new `GuardrailViolationError` variant of `KindgiError` (`code: 'guardrail-violation'`, `violations[]` with `guardrailId` / `severity` / `action` / `reason?`, `evaluationErrors[]`). `fromWire()` previously returned it as a generic `ServerError`. Exhaustive `switch (err.code)` statements need the new case.
  - `@kindgi/api`: `POST /v1/runs` sends a binding failure's `details` as the wire error's `details`; they were nested under `details.details`, so clients could not read them.
- aec851d: Messages and variable descriptions no longer point at internal components: `KINDGI_API_PORT` / `KINDGI_OPENFGA_API_URL` / `KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND` descriptions say what the runtime does; the `external` guardrail strategy's error says to register an execution strategy; the payload-version error reads "Unsupported payload version N (this reader handles version M)" — it was worded "newer than this reader" also for older versions.
- aec851d: LLM-judge guardrails route under the tenant policy.
  
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: `EvaluationBindings.tenantPolicy`. When set, the judge model is routed under it (provider / model allow and deny lists, `regionAllow`, caps), and an explicit `judgeProvider` must satisfy it too — otherwise the check fails with `judge-routing-failed`. Previously judges were routed with no tenant policy, so a tenant restricted to one region could have its run output sent to a judge model elsewhere.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: the turn passes the tenant policy it was routed under (bound policy merged with the policy registry's) to guardrail evaluation; `evaluateGate` takes it as an optional fourth argument.
- aec851d: Two error messages (`invokeAgent` without `bindings.runBinding`; provenance `emit` without an `emitBinding`) now say which binding to pass instead of naming a runtime-internal factory.
- aec851d: Tool inputs get their Zod defaults, transforms and refinements.
  
  - `@kindgi/schema`:
    - `toJSONSchema(schema, io)` and `toJSONSchemaSync(schema, converter, io)` take a required `io` (`SchemaIo`, `'input'` or `'output'`). The two sides differ exactly where Zod defaults: on the input side a `.default()` field is optional, on the output side it is required. Before, every conversion produced the output side.
    - `parseWithSchema(schema, value)` parses through a Zod schema's Standard Schema interface: defaults, transforms and refinements applied, or the issues.
  - `@kindgi/tools`:
    - A tool's advertised input schema is the input side, so a model may leave a defaulted field out.
    - `invokeTool` validates a copy of the input, filling in JSON Schema `default`s. A Zod-authored tool's input is then parsed with `inputZod`, so the handler gets its parsed input. A failed refinement is `input-validation-failed`, with the field's path.
    - A handler's input type defaults to `InferOutput` of the input schema, the parsed type.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: `runWorker`, which the pack service runs tools through, prepares the input the same way. The indexer converts tool inputs and guardrail config on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: a check's config schema converts on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: a typed agent's output schema converts on the output side, so downstream steps can rely on every field.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the tools skill explains what a handler receives.
