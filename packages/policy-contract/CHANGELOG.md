## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: A tenant can hold every agent to its own approval rules: a new policy kind, `hitl`.
  
  - `@kindgi/policy-contract`:
    - **The kind.** `hitl` joins `POLICY_KINDS`. Its spec, `HitlSpec` (`{ maxTimeoutMs?, minReviewerRole?, tools? }`), only tightens an agent's own approval rules: the shorter timeout, the higher reviewer role, and per tool id the stricter gate. `tools` maps a tool id to a mode (`never_ask`, `ask_on_first_use`, `always_ask`) or a rule `{ mode, requiredRole? }`.
    - **Exports.** `HitlSpec`, `ToolHitlMode`, `ToolHitlRule`, `ReviewerRole`, `TOOL_HITL_MODES`, `REVIEWER_ROLES`, `validateHitlSpec`, `combineHitlSpecs` (one spec at least as strict as each), and the helpers `toolHitlRule`, `stricterToolHitlRule`, `higherRole`.
    - **`validatePolicySpec(kind, spec)`** checks a spec against its kind's contract, for `tool-errors` and `hitl`. Other kinds pass.
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Applied per turn.** A turn resolves its approval rules once, at `setup` (and again when it resumes): the agent's `conversationPolicy.hitl`, held to the tenant's `hitl` policy through `policyRegistry`. Each tool call is gated by the stricter of the agent's rule for that tool and the tenant's.
    - **Fails closed.** When the tenant's `hitl` policy can't be evaluated, the turn fails with the new `tenant-policy-unavailable` error (`TenantPolicyUnavailableError`, which carries `policyKind`). Running without the policy would skip the tenant's approvals. No `hitl` executor bound means no tenant policy, as before.
    - **Breaking (preview):** `resolveEffectiveHitlPolicy({ tenant, agent })` takes the tenant's `HitlSpec` or `undefined`. `TenantHitlPolicy` is removed. `EffectiveHitlPolicy` gains `toolFloors`. An agent's tool modes and rules use `@kindgi/policy-contract`'s `ToolHitlMode` and `ToolHitlRule`, unchanged in shape.
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - **Checked when written.** `POST /v1/policies` refuses a `tool-errors` or `hitl` spec that breaks its contract, with `validation-failed`. Each issue is pathed under `spec`, e.g. `spec/tools/acme.pay/mode`. Before, such a spec was stored and only found out on a turn.
    - **Status.** `tenant-policy-unavailable` maps to 503. `PolicyKind` includes `hitl`.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `PolicyKind` includes `hitl`. The Python client's models do too.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the agents skills (TypeScript and Python) say a tenant's `hitl` policy can tighten an agent's gates, never loosen them.
- aec851d: Failed tool calls go back to the model to correct, under a policy.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Retries.** When a tool call fails, the failure goes back to the model as the call's result (what failed, the validation issues, what to do), and the turn continues. A failure the policy doesn't retry, or one past its retries, fails the turn as before.
    - **The setting.** `Agent.toolErrors` (`{ maxRetries?, retryOn? }`) sets how many failed calls go back per turn and for which kinds. Default: one retry, for `invalid-arguments` and `unknown-tool`, where nothing ran. `tool-error` (a tool that ran and failed) is opt-in.
    - **Bounds.** Each retry costs a step against `budget.maxSteps`. Retries are counted from the turn's messages, so a replayed turn counts the same.
    - **Errors.** `tool-invocation-failed` and `unresolved-tool` carry `toolRetries` when retries ran out.
    - **Exports.** `DEFAULT_TOOL_ERRORS` and `effectiveToolErrorPolicy`. A rejected HITL tool approval writes its result through the same path as a retry.
  - `@kindgi/policy-contract`:
    - A new policy kind, `tool-errors`. It caps an agent's setting, like every tenant policy: the fewer retries wins, and only kinds both allow are retried.
    - `ToolErrorsSpec`, `ToolErrorKind`, `TOOL_ERROR_KINDS`, `MAX_TOOL_ERROR_RETRIES` (10), and `validateToolErrorsSpec`.
  - `@kindgi/specs`: `agent.schema.json` schema-version 1.3.0 adds `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/api`: the `Agent` and `PublishAgentBody` schemas accept `toolErrors` (`ToolErrorsSpec`). `PolicyKind` derives from `POLICY_KINDS`, so it includes `tool-errors`.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: the indexer carries an agent's `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `PolicyKind` includes `tool-errors`, and the generated agent types carry `toolErrors`.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the agents skill covers `output` and `toolErrors`, and `preferredModel` as `defineAgent` keeps it.
