# @kindgi/crypto

## 0.1.5-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- 646a906: **Signed exports work end to end: one export key, one envelope, and a verifier.** An approval's audit bundle, a run's provenance and compliance evidence are signed with the deployment's export key.
  
  - **The key:** `createApp({ exportSigning })` takes an `ExportSigningBinding` (`@kindgi/crypto`: async, so a KMS can back it; `createEd25519ExportSigner` for a key file). Key ids are derived from the public key (`ex_…`). The old `signingKey` still works, deprecated. On the runtime: `KINDGI_EXPORT_SIGNING_KEY_PATH`, `KINDGI_EXPORT_SIGNING_KEY` (base64 PEM, for Secret Manager) or the optional `KINDGI_EXPORT_SIGNING_KMS_KEY`; `kindgi dev` passes a key file through, or the runtime makes one.
  - **Two algorithms, chosen per key:** an Ed25519 key signs `ed25519` (the default); an EC P-256 key signs `ecdsa-p256-sha256`, for a key store without Ed25519 (a Cloud KMS `EC_SIGN_P256_SHA256` key, say). Its signature is IEEE P1363 `r‖s`. `createExportSignerFromPem` reads the algorithm from the key; `ecdsaDerToP1363` converts a KMS's DER signature. Both verifiers check either, and refuse an algorithm they don't know, naming it. Shared test vectors for both are in `@kindgi/specs` (`test-vectors/signed-export/`).
  - **One envelope:** the signed bytes (`bundle`), the signature, the public key, an optional `kind`, and `exportedAt`, which is now signed and the same in the envelope. Body versions: the audit bundle is `2.0.0` (a string; it was the integer `1`), provenance `1.2.0` (adds the signed `exportedAt`), compliance `1.0.0`.
  - **No body needed:** `signingKeyId` is optional (the active key), and an empty body reads as `{}`. **Behaviour change:** a `POST` to one of the three exports with no body, or without `signingKeyId`, used to answer `400 bad-input`; it now signs with the active key.
  - **Each export is recorded** as an `export-signed` audit event (who, what, which key, the SHA-256 of the signed bytes). An export whose record can't be written isn't handed out.
  - **`GET /v1/export-signing-keys`** lists the public keys to pin; `exportSigningKeys.list()` in the TS client.
  - **Verify:** `verifySignedExport` in `@kindgi/client` and `@kindgi/sdk/client` (Web Crypto); `approvals.audit.verify`, `provenance.verify` and `compliance.evidence.verify` now work. Python: `kindgi.exports.verify_signed_export` (`pip install 'kindgi[verify]'`). CLI: `kindgi exports verify <file> [--trust=<pem>] [--from-runtime]`.
  - **CLI:** `kindgi approvals export <approval-id>`; `kindgi provenance export`'s `--signing-key` is optional.
  - **Compliance:** `collectEvidence` builds an export's records, so the generator's `exportSigned` is optional and deprecated.
  - **Specs:** `signed-export.schema.json` (the envelope), and `audit-bundle.schema.json` 2.0.0 describes the bundle the API exports.
  - **Cloud Run module:** `export_signing = "secret" | "kms"` (opt-in).

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: Outbound webhooks: endpoints that receive a signed `run.finished` event when a top-level run completes, fails or is cancelled.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `WebhookEndpointBinding` (caller-plugged) and `/v1/webhook-endpoints`: create (the response carries the signing secret, once), list, get, update, `unregister`, `rotate-secret`, the delivery log (`/deliveries`, with a status filter), `redeliver`, and `test` (queues a `webhook.test` event).
    - Endpoint filter: `projectId`, `flowIds`, `includeDryRuns`. Child runs never produce `run.finished`.
    - Event bodies (`RunFinishedEvent`, `WebhookTestEvent`) carry the run's identity and outcome (`FinishedRun`), never its input or output. The OpenAPI document describes them under `webhooks`.
    - Error codes: `webhook-endpoint-not-found`, `webhook-delivery-not-found` (404), `webhook-url-refused` (400).
  - `@kindgi/crypto`: Standard Webhooks signatures (`v1`, HMAC-SHA256): `signWebhook`, `webhookHeaders`, `verifyWebhook` (timestamp tolerance, several signatures during a secret rotation, constant-time comparison) and `generateWebhookSecret` (`whsec_…`). Checked against the reference implementation both ways.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `client.webhookEndpoints`. The unused outbound shapes `Webhook`, `WebhookSpec`, `WebhookSecret`, `WebhookDelivery`, `WebhookVerifyResult` and the `WebhookId` / `WebhookDeliveryId` brands are replaced by the generated wire types and `WebhookEndpointId`; `SubscriptionSpec`'s webhook target is `{ kind: 'webhook', endpoint }`.
  - `@kindgi/types`: `WebhookEndpointId` and `WebhookEventId`. `WebhookId` is documented as what it is: the routable id of an inbound webhook trigger.
- aec851d: Webhook endpoints reference their signing secret by name instead of generating and returning one.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - Endpoints take `secretRef: { envName, name }`, a secret in the deployment's secrets store (resolved at tenant scope), like a provider's `secret_ref`. The secret is shared with the receiver, so it lives with the deployment's other secrets: `.env` in development, the secrets store in production. Endpoints show `secretRef`; `secretHint` is gone.
    - Create and update check that the secret exists and is strong (`400 webhook-secret-not-found`, `400 webhook-secret-too-weak`). `create` returns the endpoint (no secret).
    - `POST /v1/webhook-endpoints/generate-secret` returns a strong secret to store; nothing is kept.
    - `POST /v1/webhook-endpoints/{endpointId}/rotate-secret` and `WebhookEndpointWithSecret` are removed: rotating is rotating the referenced secret (`POST /v1/secrets/{name}/rotate`), and for a day deliveries are signed with both versions.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `webhookEndpoints.create` takes `secretRef` and returns the endpoint; `webhookEndpoints.generateSecret()`; `rotateSecret` is removed.
  - `@kindgi/crypto`: `isStrongWebhookSecret` and `WEBHOOK_SECRET_MIN_BYTES` (24).
