### Minor Changes

- aec851d: Flows take plain string ids. `defineFlow`'s `FlowSpec` is now `Unbranded<Flow>`: an author writes `id: 'acme.triage-ticket'`, node `id: 'parse'`, edge `from: 'parse'` with no `as FlowId` / `as NodeId` / `as EdgeId` (and no cast on the whole object); branded ids still fit, and the validated `Flow` is branded. `@kindgi/types` exports `Unbranded<T>` (every branded string in `T` loosened to `string`, all the way down). `runs.start({ flow })` / `({ agent })` take a plain string too.
- aec851d: Outbound webhooks: endpoints that receive a signed `run.finished` event when a top-level run completes, fails or is cancelled.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `WebhookEndpointBinding` (caller-plugged) and `/v1/webhook-endpoints`: create (the response carries the signing secret, once), list, get, update, `unregister`, `rotate-secret`, the delivery log (`/deliveries`, with a status filter), `redeliver`, and `test` (queues a `webhook.test` event).
    - Endpoint filter: `projectId`, `flowIds`, `includeDryRuns`. Child runs never produce `run.finished`.
    - Event bodies (`RunFinishedEvent`, `WebhookTestEvent`) carry the run's identity and outcome (`FinishedRun`), never its input or output. The OpenAPI document describes them under `webhooks`.
    - Error codes: `webhook-endpoint-not-found`, `webhook-delivery-not-found` (404), `webhook-url-refused` (400).
  - `@kindgi/crypto`: Standard Webhooks signatures (`v1`, HMAC-SHA256): `signWebhook`, `webhookHeaders`, `verifyWebhook` (timestamp tolerance, several signatures during a secret rotation, constant-time comparison) and `generateWebhookSecret` (`whsec_…`). Checked against the reference implementation both ways.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `client.webhookEndpoints`. The unused outbound shapes `Webhook`, `WebhookSpec`, `WebhookSecret`, `WebhookDelivery`, `WebhookVerifyResult` and the `WebhookId` / `WebhookDeliveryId` brands are replaced by the generated wire types and `WebhookEndpointId`; `SubscriptionSpec`'s webhook target is `{ kind: 'webhook', endpoint }`.
  - `@kindgi/types`: `WebhookEndpointId` and `WebhookEventId`. `WebhookId` is documented as what it is: the routable id of an inbound webhook trigger.
