## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- eff6249: Improvement proposals change data blocks. A proposal is new settings values or a new prompt template for one block an agent version pins, for one live scope:
  - `POST /v1/proposals` drafts one. The content is checked as publishing that block version would be, and refused when it equals the pinned content. The same change from the same version for the same scope is one proposal.
  - `POST /v1/proposals/{id}/evaluate` publishes the block version, derives the agent version (`derivedFrom.proposalId`) and compares it on a test set. Neither serves any scope until promoted. Without a live version of the agent for the whole tenant, it answers `409 proposal-needs-pin`. Under `kindgi dev`, where the agent registry takes no writes, it answers `409 registry-read-only`.
  - `POST /v1/proposals/{id}/request` promotes the candidate for the scope through its gate, as `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions` does. It's allowed whether or not the candidate measured better: the gate decides.
  - `POST /v1/proposals/{id}/rollback` puts the scope back.
  - `POST /v1/proposals/{id}/withdraw` closes the proposal.
  - `GET /v1/proposals` filters by agent, tier, status, and the live scope a proposal is for (`scopeKind`, `scopeId`, `segment`).
  - `status` is derived from the comparison and the promotion: `draft`, `evaluating`, `evaluated`, `not-better`, `evaluation-failed`, `in-review`, `promoted`, `refused`, `rejected`, `expired`, `superseded`, `rolled-back` or `withdrawn`.
  - Proposals are authorized on their agent: `read` to see one; `publish` to draft, evaluate or withdraw; `promote` to request or roll back. `X-Supervisor-Id` is no longer needed.
  
  The instruction-string tiers (`prompt`, `retrieval`, `tool-config`) and the `dry-run`, `submit-review` and `apply` routes are gone.
  
  The TypeScript client has `client.proposals` (`list`, `get`, `create`, `evaluate`, `request`, `rollback`, `withdraw`). Every `client.supervisor.proposals` method now throws `not-yet-wired`, naming its replacement, until 0.2. The Python client's `proposals` resource has the new calls. `draft`, `dry_run`, `submit_review` and `apply` raise `InvalidRequestError`, naming their replacement.
  
  `SupervisorBinding` stores proposals (`listProposals`, `getProposal`, `createProposal`, and `recordProposal`, a compare-and-set on `revision`). The API package runs the lifecycle from the agent, block, eval-run and promotion bindings.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- fac7472: **Derive an agent version with new data-block pins, with no code change.** An expert edits a prompt or settings block and publishes a new version of it; deriving an agent version is how that edit reaches the agent.
  
  - **`POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/versions`** `{ from, pins: { prompts?, settings? }, label?, projectId? }`:
    - The new version is `from` with the named pins swapped, everything else kept.
    - It's numbered the next free patch after the agent's highest version (versions never change).
    - It records `derivedFrom: { version, reason: 'edited', label?, by: 'user:<id>' }`.
    - Answers `201` with the new agent version.
    - Needs `publish` on the agent.
  - **Refusals** (`400 validation-failed`, naming each problem under `details.issues`):
    - a version published before pins;
    - a block the version doesn't already reference (adding one is a code change);
    - a block version that isn't published, is unregistered, is the wrong kind, or isn't model settings for the model-settings block;
    - swaps that change nothing.
    - Tool pins can't be swapped: they come from code.
    - An unknown version answers `404 agent-not-found`.
  - **Clients:**
    - TS: `client.agents.versions.derive(agentId, { from, pins, label })`.
    - Python: `client.agents.derive_version(agent_id, from_=..., pins=...)`.
    - CLI: `kindgi agents derive <agent-id> --from=<semver> --prompt=<block-id>=<version> --setting=<block-id>=<version> [--label=<text>]`. Repeat `--prompt` and `--setting` for several blocks.
  - **A taken number is never overwritten.** `POST /v1/agents` with a version that's already registered (a derived version may hold it) still answers `409 agent-already-registered`. It now names the next free version in the message and as `nextFreeVersion`: `… is already registered, and versions never change; publish it as 1.4.2, the next free version`.
  - **Deploys:** a deploy whose definition and pins match a derived version reuses it, reporting the deploy's own reason (`pins-changed`), not `edited`.
  - **`VersionDerivation`:** `reason` adds `'edited'`; new optional `label` and `by`.
- 26b2a23: **A flow version is pinned when it's published, as an agent version is.** `POST /v1/flows` pins each tool the flow runs to its latest active version: tool nodes, fanout branches, and nodes in loop bodies. It also pins each agent the flow runs at no named version (an agent node without `config.version`). The result is stored on the version as `pins` (`{tools, agents}`) with `pinsDigest`, and every run of that flow version uses those versions. A new tool or agent version reaches the flow only through a new flow version. An agent node with its own `config.version` keeps it.
  
  - **Refusals:** a tool or agent with no published version refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`, naming each).
  - **Deploys** pin flows after agents and follow the same rule as agents, from one shared code path. When pins change, the deploy registers the next free version with `derivedFrom`, and a redeploy is idempotent. So one tool change cascades through an agent into a flow within a single deploy, each derived once. The deployment's `contents.flows` names each flow's registered version (`DeployedVersion`), and `kindgi deploy` prints one line per renumbered flow.
  - **Unchanged:** a flow version published before pins binds the latest versions per run, as before.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/flow`: `FlowPins`, `flowPinsDigest()` and `flowRefs()`.
    - `@kindgi/types`: `VersionDerivation`.
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `PinChange.kind` adds `agent`, and `pinChanges()` takes any pin set. `withVersions(flow, { tools?, agents? })` (`@kindgi/flow`) runs a flow version with some blocks at other exact versions through the same pins: what a comparison or replay runs, with `pinsDigest` recomputed.
- 2040daf: Live versions and promotions. An agent version can be made live for a scope: the tenant, an org, a project, or a segment path inside a project (an ordered list of `key:value` steps, coarse to fine, such as company then role). A run that doesn't name its version uses the live version of the most specific scope that has one, else the latest registered version, and records how its version was chosen.
  
  `@kindgi/api` adds `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live` (the version a run would use for a project and segment path, and why), `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live-versions` (every pin), `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions`, `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions[/{promotionId}]` (the history), and `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/live/rollback` and `/live/unpin`. They're mounted when `createApp` gets `agentReleases` (`AgentReleaseBindings`: a `LiveVersionBinding` and a `PromotionBinding`). Promoting, rolling back and unpinning need the new `promote` action on the agent (`@kindgi/authz`). `POST /v1/runs` takes `segments`; a run carries them (`segments`, a child run has its parent's), and a run's `agent` carries `via` (`explicit`, `conversation`, `live` or `latest`) and, for a live version, `liveScope`. `@kindgi/types` adds `LiveScope`, `ScopeSegment` and `AgentVersionVia`; `@kindgi/runtime`'s `RunAgentRef` and `@kindgi/agents`' `InvokeAgentInput` carry `via` and `liveScope`, and `InvokeAgentInput` the turn's `segments`; `RunFlowInput`, `StartRunParams` and `KernelRunRecord` carry the run's `segments`, so a flow's agent steps resolve with them after a resume too. `@kindgi/compliance` and `@kindgi/specs` list the evidence kinds `agent-promotion`, `agent-rollback`, `agent-live-unpinned` and `agent-live-pin-inactive` (a live version that was unregistered: runs use the scope above).
  
  `@kindgi/client` adds `client.agents.live` (`resolve`, `list`, `rollback`, `unpin`), `client.agents.promotions` (`create`, `list`, `get`) and `segments` on `runs.start`; an array query value now repeats its key; `agent-version-not-found` and `promotion-not-found` read as not-found, `nothing-to-roll-back` and `not-pinned` as conflicts, `scope-invalid` as an invalid request. The Python client has the same resources and errors. `@kindgi/cli` adds `kindgi agents live | live-versions | promote | rollback | unpin` and `kindgi agents promotions list | get`, and wires `kindgi agents list | get | versions | unregister`; `kindgi runs start` takes `--project` and `--segment=key:value` (repeated); `get` and `unregister` take the version as an argument (`kindgi agents unregister <agent-id> <version>`). A command's repeatable flag (`--segment=company:acme --segment=role:counsel`) keeps every value.
- ae417f7: A flow's agent step that runs the version its flow version holds records `via: 'flow-pin'` on its turn (`Run.agent.via`), not `explicit`: the node's `config.version`, else the version the flow version pinned when it was published. `explicit` now means only a version named on the run itself. In the TypeScript and Python clients, `via` gains the value.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 1463b77: Approvals, conversations and provenance list by project, as runs do. `GET /v1/approvals`, `GET /v1/conversations` and `GET /v1/provenance` take `scopeKind=project|org` + `scopeId`: one project's records, or every project's in an org. A `scopeId` that isn't a UUID is `400 scope-invalid`. The records say their project:
  - an agent's approvals are enqueued in the turn's project (`HitlEnqueueInput.projectId`);
  - a conversation has `projectId`, set by the run that opens it or by `POST /v1/conversations`' new `projectId` (one of the tenant's projects, else `400 bad-input`; omitted, the tenant's Default project, as for a run); `agent_conversations` gets a nullable `project_id` (migration `0003`);
  - a provenance record's list row has `projectId`, which the emitter passes beside the signed document (`ProvenanceEmitBinding.emit(provenance, { projectId })`).
  
  `ListScope` (`@kindgi/types`) is the scope of each binding's list input. TypeScript client: `scope` on `approvals.list`, `conversations.list` and `provenance.query`, and `projectId` on `conversations.open`; the Python client takes `scope_kind` / `scope_id` and `project_id` (regenerated). Records from before this release have no project, so only a list without a scope shows them (nothing is backfilled).

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.

## 0.1.1

No changes in this release.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: Flows take plain string ids. `defineFlow`'s `FlowSpec` is now `Unbranded<Flow>`: an author writes `id: 'acme.triage-ticket'`, node `id: 'parse'`, edge `from: 'parse'` with no `as FlowId` / `as NodeId` / `as EdgeId` (and no cast on the whole object); branded ids still fit, and the validated `Flow` is branded. `@kindgi/types` exports `Unbranded<T>` (every branded string in `T` loosened to `string`, all the way down). `runs.start({ flow })` / `({ agent })` take a plain string too.
- aec851d: Outbound webhooks: endpoints that receive a signed `run.finished` event when a top-level run completes, fails or is cancelled.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `WebhookEndpointBinding` (caller-plugged) and `/v1/webhook-endpoints`: create (the response carries the signing secret, once), list, get, update, `unregister`, `rotate-secret`, the delivery log (`/deliveries`, with a status filter), `redeliver`, and `test` (queues a `webhook.test` event).
    - Endpoint filter: `projectId`, `flowIds`, `includeDryRuns`. Child runs never produce `run.finished`.
    - Event bodies (`RunFinishedEvent`, `WebhookTestEvent`) carry the run's identity and outcome (`FinishedRun`), never its input or output. The OpenAPI document describes them under `webhooks`.
    - Error codes: `webhook-endpoint-not-found`, `webhook-delivery-not-found` (404), `webhook-url-refused` (400).
  - `@kindgi/crypto`: Standard Webhooks signatures (`v1`, HMAC-SHA256): `signWebhook`, `webhookHeaders`, `verifyWebhook` (timestamp tolerance, several signatures during a secret rotation, constant-time comparison) and `generateWebhookSecret` (`whsec_…`). Checked against the reference implementation both ways.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `client.webhookEndpoints`. The unused outbound shapes `Webhook`, `WebhookSpec`, `WebhookSecret`, `WebhookDelivery`, `WebhookVerifyResult` and the `WebhookId` / `WebhookDeliveryId` brands are replaced by the generated wire types and `WebhookEndpointId`; `SubscriptionSpec`'s webhook target is `{ kind: 'webhook', endpoint }`.
  - `@kindgi/types`: `WebhookEndpointId` and `WebhookEventId`. `WebhookId` is documented as what it is: the routable id of an inbound webhook trigger.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: Copyright holder in every source header is Kindgi Inc.; the `@kindgi/handler-runtime` README now states its actual license (Apache-2.0). No code changes.
