### Patch Changes

- ebf405d: **Where a secret an item names is read is decided when the item is registered, and recorded on it.**
  - **Which items:** an MCP endpoint (`secretRef`, `auth.secretRef`), a tool (a spec tool's `secretRef`, the secrets a pack tool declares; through `POST /v1/tools` or a deployment), and a webhook trigger's signing secret.
  - **How it's decided:** the secret is looked for at the item's own scope, then its project's org, then the tenant, at the scopes the person registering it administers. The first that has it is recorded. If none has it yet, the broadest scope they administer is: the tenant for a tenant admin, the project for a project admin. Nothing is refused for it.
  - **What's recorded:** `secretScopes` (by name) on an MCP endpoint and a tool version, `hmacSecretScope` on a webhook trigger. They're the server's, never a caller's. The runtime reads the secret there only. A secret removed from that scope is missing, never read from a broader one, and one set later at another scope changes nothing until it's recorded again: a tool by publishing a new version, an MCP endpoint by unregistering it and registering it again, a webhook trigger by an update that names its secret.
  - **Webhook triggers:** the receiver reads the signing secret at `hmacSecretScope`; a trigger registered before it was recorded reads the tenant's, as before.
  - **`generateSecret`:** `POST /v1/webhooks` can make the signing secret itself, in the trigger's project, needing only `write` there; the answer carries it once (`signingSecret`). A name the project already has is refused (`409 secret-write-conflict`). `kindgi webhooks register --generate-secret` now uses it, in one call, and no longer takes `--env`.
  - **Read there only:** `SecretResolveInput.exact` reads at the given scope with no walk to a broader one, and every secrets store must honour it. `SecretResolveOutcome.scope` says where a value was read. `resolveAtScope` reads an item's secret at its recorded scope with `exact`. A value a store reads at another scope anyway, or without saying which, is refused as not set, and the refusal is audited (`secret-resolved`, failed, `secret-scope-mismatch`) without the value. A custom store must honour `exact` and report the scope it read. The dotenv store keeps one set of values for every scope, so it reports the scope it was asked at.
  - **`emitResolveEvent`** (`@kindgi/compliance`): `projectId` is optional, for a read at the tenant or an org.
  - **`CreateAppInput.envName`:** the env this deployment serves, where the secrets a tool's code declares are looked for.
  - **`RecordedSecretScope`** (`@kindgi/types`): the recorded scope's shape.

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- b90e2c6: **Webhook triggers start runs: a signed request from WooCommerce, Drupal's Webhooks module, GitHub, Shopify or any Standard Webhooks sender starts a run of a flow.**
  
  - **The receiver, `POST /v1/hooks/{tenantId}/{webhookId}`,** sits outside the bearer chain. The request's signature, made with the trigger's secret over the raw body, is what lets it start the trigger's flow as the trigger's owner; a bearer token, if sent, is never read.
    - **One answer for any request that doesn't prove its sender:** an unknown tenant or id, a missing, wrong or stale signature, or a secret that can't be read is `401 webhook-refused`. The reason goes only to the trigger's deliveries and, for the sender's own failures, the access audit (actor `webhook-sender`, the address in `evidence.clientAddress`); a secret that can't be read is the deployment's to fix, so it's on the deliveries only.
    - **Gone and paused:** an unregistered trigger is `410 webhook-gone`, but only to a sender that proved itself. A paused trigger takes the delivery (`202`, a `skipped` fire) and starts nothing: the event is dropped.
    - **Repeats:** a delivery whose dedupe key an earlier fire holds starts nothing (`200`, `duplicate: true`). The key is the trigger's delivery-id header and the body, because WooCommerce's delivery id is per second, not per event.
    - **WooCommerce's ping:** its unsigned save-time ping (`webhook_id=<n>`) is answered `200` before any lookup.
    - **Limits:**
      - a body past 1 MiB, or past the trigger's `bodyLimitBytes` (default 256 KiB), is `413 webhook-body-too-large`;
      - deliveries past the trigger's `rateLimitPerMinute` (default 600) are `429`;
      - past 60 refusals a minute from one address (`webhookReceiver.clientAddress`), that address's further refusals are `429` and not recorded. The limit is checked only after verification: a validly signed delivery is never refused because of anyone's refusals, its own address's included. An unreadable secret never counts against a sender;
      - a trigger records 20 refusals and skipped deliveries a minute, then only counts them (`suppressedRefusals`).
    - **The signing key:** the receiver keeps a trigger's key for up to 10 seconds (`WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY_TTL_MS`), as a `KeyObject`, never a string, so a flood of bad signatures costs one secret read a trigger. A write through `createApp`'s secrets routes drops it at once; another instance's write is seen within those 10 seconds.
    - **The event:** the flow's event is the body, parsed as JSON for a JSON content type (else `400 webhook-body-not-json`), or its text otherwise.
    - **Mounting:** the receiver mounts with `createApp`'s new `webhookReceiver` (`envName`, `clientAddress`, `rateLimitStore`) when the trigger registry implements `findWebhook`, `fireWebhook` and `recordWebhookRefusal`, which replace `fetchActiveByWebhookId` (as `SchedulerBinding.fireByWebhookId` goes).
  - **Webhook triggers are served again** (`/v1/webhooks` was hidden while no runtime served it), on the schedules model:
    - **Project and owner:** a trigger has a project (`projectId`; the Default project if none is named) and an owner (the registrant, rechecked at every delivery).
    - **Access:** it follows the project: `read`, `write`, `admin` to take ownership, plus `execute` on the flow to register, change the version or take ownership.
    - **The signing scheme:** register and update take `signature` (`hmac-sha256` with a `hex` or `base64` header and an optional prefix, or `standard-webhooks`), `deliveryIdHeader`, `bodyLimitBytes` and `rateLimitPerMinute`. An update also takes `hmacSecretName`; `null` clears the last three.
    - **Provider keys:** a model provider's key is refused as a trigger's secret (`400 provider-key-refused`); the receiver reads its secret through a guarded binding (`SecretUser` `'a webhook trigger'`), and `provider-key-in-use` names webhook triggers too.
    - **New routes:** `GET /v1/webhooks?projectId=`, `GET /v1/webhooks/{id}/fires` (the deliveries; a fire keeps the event only until its run starts) and `POST /v1/webhooks/{id}/owner`.
    - **The receive URL:** records carry `receiveUrl`, made from `createApp`'s new `publicUrl`, never from a request's `Host`. They also carry `owner`, `signature`, `bodyLimitBytes`, `rateLimitPerMinute` and `statusReason`.
  - **`@kindgi/crypto`'s `verifyInboundSignature`** checks a request in a trigger's scheme, with Standard Webhooks through `verifyWebhook`; it takes the secret, or the `KeyObject` that `inboundSigningKey(scheme, secret)` derives from it (which `JSON.stringify` shows as `{}`). `@kindgi/types` has `WebhookSignatureScheme`.
  - **The OpenAPI marks the receiver `x-kindgi-sender-only`:** the client generators skip it, because the receive URL is the sender's path, not a client's.
  - **The TypeScript client** has `webhooks` again (`register`, `list`, `get`, `update`, `pause`, `resume`, `unregister`, `fires`, `takeOwnership`), and `@kindgi/sdk` exports `WebhooksClient`. The Python client has `client.webhooks`.
  - **The CLI adds `kindgi webhooks`:** `register`, `list`, `get`, `update`, `pause`, `resume`, `fires`, `take-ownership` and `unregister`.
    - **`register --preset=woocommerce|drupal-webhooks|github|shopify|standard-webhooks`** sets a sender's scheme and delivery-id header.
    - **`--generate-secret --env=<env>`** makes a new secret (letters and digits; `whsec_…` for Standard Webhooks), stores it once the trigger is registered (a refused register leaves none behind), and shows it once.
    - **The receive URL:** register and get print it, or why there's none (no `KINDGI_PUBLIC_URL`).
    - **`pause`** says that a paused trigger drops events.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- b4bbd95: **A secret that can't go in a header is refused by its name, never quoted.** When a header value has a line break or a NUL inside it, fetch refuses it with an error that quotes the whole value (`Headers.append: "<value>" is an invalid header value.`). A secret pasted with its next line ended up, whole, in the error. For a declarative HTTP tool, that error became the tool call's failure message, stored with the run and its journal. For a model adapter, it was the model call's failure, and so in the logs.
  - **HTTP tools (`spec: { kind: 'http' }`):** the resolved secret (`bearer` or `header`) is checked before the request. A bad one fails the call with `http-tool "<id>": its secret <env>/<name> for the header "<header>" has a line break, which a header can't carry: store the secret without it`. Headers filled from the input are checked the same way, by name.
  - **Model adapters (Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible for chat, Responses and embeddings, Gemini):** the resolved API key is checked on every call, before a client is built or reused: `<adapter>: provider "<id>": its API key has a line break, which a header can't carry: store the secret without it`.
  - **What still works:** a trailing line break is fine, since fetch drops it, and so is a tab or a Latin-1 character. Other control characters, which the request refuses anyway, are refused here by name too.
  - **Checked as it's sent:** `Bearer ` and a secret that starts with a line break make it an inner one, which fetch refuses, so the bearer paths (an HTTP tool's `bearer`, the OpenAI-compatible adapter) check `Bearer <secret>`.
  - **New in `@kindgi/types`:** `headerValueProblem(value)`, the rule all of these use, and `bearerValueProblem(token)`, the same for `Bearer <token>`.
  - **Records made before:** a failure message already stored keeps what it recorded. Rotate a secret that was ever pasted with a line break.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- eff6249: Improvement proposals change data blocks. A proposal is new settings values or a new prompt template for one block an agent version pins, for one live scope:
  - `POST /v1/proposals` drafts one. The content is checked as publishing that block version would be, and refused when it equals the pinned content. The same change from the same version for the same scope is one proposal.
  - `POST /v1/proposals/{id}/evaluate` publishes the block version, derives the agent version (`derivedFrom.proposalId`) and compares it on a test set. Neither serves any scope until promoted. Without a live version of the agent for the whole tenant, it answers `409 proposal-needs-pin`. Under `kindgi dev`, where the agent registry takes no writes, it answers `409 registry-read-only`.
  - `POST /v1/proposals/{id}/request` promotes the candidate for the scope through its gate, as `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions` does. It's allowed whether or not the candidate measured better: the gate decides.
  - `POST /v1/proposals/{id}/rollback` puts the scope back.
  - `POST /v1/proposals/{id}/withdraw` closes the proposal.
  - `GET /v1/proposals` filters by agent, tier, status, and the live scope a proposal is for (`scopeKind`, `scopeId`, `segment`).
  - `status` is derived from the comparison and the promotion: `draft`, `evaluating`, `evaluated`, `not-better`, `evaluation-failed`, `in-review`, `promoted`, `refused`, `rejected`, `expired`, `superseded`, `rolled-back` or `withdrawn`.
  - Proposals are authorized on their agent: `read` to see one; `publish` to draft, evaluate or withdraw; `promote` to request or roll back. `X-Supervisor-Id` is no longer needed.
  
  The instruction-string tiers (`prompt`, `retrieval`, `tool-config`) and the `dry-run`, `submit-review` and `apply` routes are gone.
  
  The TypeScript client has `client.proposals` (`list`, `get`, `create`, `evaluate`, `request`, `rollback`, `withdraw`). Every `client.supervisor.proposals` method now throws `not-yet-wired`, naming its replacement, until 0.2. The Python client's `proposals` resource has the new calls. `draft`, `dry_run`, `submit_review` and `apply` raise `InvalidRequestError`, naming their replacement.
  
  `SupervisorBinding` stores proposals (`listProposals`, `getProposal`, `createProposal`, and `recordProposal`, a compare-and-set on `revision`). The API package runs the lifecycle from the agent, block, eval-run and promotion bindings.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- fac7472: **Derive an agent version with new data-block pins, with no code change.** An expert edits a prompt or settings block and publishes a new version of it; deriving an agent version is how that edit reaches the agent.
  
  - **`POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/versions`** `{ from, pins: { prompts?, settings? }, label?, projectId? }`:
    - The new version is `from` with the named pins swapped, everything else kept.
    - It's numbered the next free patch after the agent's highest version (versions never change).
    - It records `derivedFrom: { version, reason: 'edited', label?, by: 'user:<id>' }`.
    - Answers `201` with the new agent version.
    - Needs `publish` on the agent.
  - **Refusals** (`400 validation-failed`, naming each problem under `details.issues`):
    - a version published before pins;
    - a block the version doesn't already reference (adding one is a code change);
    - a block version that isn't published, is unregistered, is the wrong kind, or isn't model settings for the model-settings block;
    - swaps that change nothing.
    - Tool pins can't be swapped: they come from code.
    - An unknown version answers `404 agent-not-found`.
  - **Clients:**
    - TS: `client.agents.versions.derive(agentId, { from, pins, label })`.
    - Python: `client.agents.derive_version(agent_id, from_=..., pins=...)`.
    - CLI: `kindgi agents derive <agent-id> --from=<semver> --prompt=<block-id>=<version> --setting=<block-id>=<version> [--label=<text>]`. Repeat `--prompt` and `--setting` for several blocks.
  - **A taken number is never overwritten.** `POST /v1/agents` with a version that's already registered (a derived version may hold it) still answers `409 agent-already-registered`. It now names the next free version in the message and as `nextFreeVersion`: `… is already registered, and versions never change; publish it as 1.4.2, the next free version`.
  - **Deploys:** a deploy whose definition and pins match a derived version reuses it, reporting the deploy's own reason (`pins-changed`), not `edited`.
  - **`VersionDerivation`:** `reason` adds `'edited'`; new optional `label` and `by`.
- 26b2a23: **A flow version is pinned when it's published, as an agent version is.** `POST /v1/flows` pins each tool the flow runs to its latest active version: tool nodes, fanout branches, and nodes in loop bodies. It also pins each agent the flow runs at no named version (an agent node without `config.version`). The result is stored on the version as `pins` (`{tools, agents}`) with `pinsDigest`, and every run of that flow version uses those versions. A new tool or agent version reaches the flow only through a new flow version. An agent node with its own `config.version` keeps it.
  
  - **Refusals:** a tool or agent with no published version refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`, naming each).
  - **Deploys** pin flows after agents and follow the same rule as agents, from one shared code path. When pins change, the deploy registers the next free version with `derivedFrom`, and a redeploy is idempotent. So one tool change cascades through an agent into a flow within a single deploy, each derived once. The deployment's `contents.flows` names each flow's registered version (`DeployedVersion`), and `kindgi deploy` prints one line per renumbered flow.
  - **Unchanged:** a flow version published before pins binds the latest versions per run, as before.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/flow`: `FlowPins`, `flowPinsDigest()` and `flowRefs()`.
    - `@kindgi/types`: `VersionDerivation`.
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `PinChange.kind` adds `agent`, and `pinChanges()` takes any pin set. `withVersions(flow, { tools?, agents? })` (`@kindgi/flow`) runs a flow version with some blocks at other exact versions through the same pins: what a comparison or replay runs, with `pinsDigest` recomputed.
- 2040daf: Live versions and promotions. An agent version can be made live for a scope: the tenant, an org, a project, or a segment path inside a project (an ordered list of `key:value` steps, coarse to fine, such as company then role). A run that doesn't name its version uses the live version of the most specific scope that has one, else the latest registered version, and records how its version was chosen.
  
  `@kindgi/api` adds `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live` (the version a run would use for a project and segment path, and why), `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/live-versions` (every pin), `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions`, `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/promotions[/{promotionId}]` (the history), and `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/live/rollback` and `/live/unpin`. They're mounted when `createApp` gets `agentReleases` (`AgentReleaseBindings`: a `LiveVersionBinding` and a `PromotionBinding`). Promoting, rolling back and unpinning need the new `promote` action on the agent (`@kindgi/authz`). `POST /v1/runs` takes `segments`; a run carries them (`segments`, a child run has its parent's), and a run's `agent` carries `via` (`explicit`, `conversation`, `live` or `latest`) and, for a live version, `liveScope`. `@kindgi/types` adds `LiveScope`, `ScopeSegment` and `AgentVersionVia`; `@kindgi/runtime`'s `RunAgentRef` and `@kindgi/agents`' `InvokeAgentInput` carry `via` and `liveScope`, and `InvokeAgentInput` the turn's `segments`; `RunFlowInput`, `StartRunParams` and `KernelRunRecord` carry the run's `segments`, so a flow's agent steps resolve with them after a resume too. `@kindgi/compliance` and `@kindgi/specs` list the evidence kinds `agent-promotion`, `agent-rollback`, `agent-live-unpinned` and `agent-live-pin-inactive` (a live version that was unregistered: runs use the scope above).
  
  `@kindgi/client` adds `client.agents.live` (`resolve`, `list`, `rollback`, `unpin`), `client.agents.promotions` (`create`, `list`, `get`) and `segments` on `runs.start`; an array query value now repeats its key; `agent-version-not-found` and `promotion-not-found` read as not-found, `nothing-to-roll-back` and `not-pinned` as conflicts, `scope-invalid` as an invalid request. The Python client has the same resources and errors. `@kindgi/cli` adds `kindgi agents live | live-versions | promote | rollback | unpin` and `kindgi agents promotions list | get`, and wires `kindgi agents list | get | versions | unregister`; `kindgi runs start` takes `--project` and `--segment=key:value` (repeated); `get` and `unregister` take the version as an argument (`kindgi agents unregister <agent-id> <version>`). A command's repeatable flag (`--segment=company:acme --segment=role:counsel`) keeps every value.
- ae417f7: A flow's agent step that runs the version its flow version holds records `via: 'flow-pin'` on its turn (`Run.agent.via`), not `explicit`: the node's `config.version`, else the version the flow version pinned when it was published. `explicit` now means only a version named on the run itself. In the TypeScript and Python clients, `via` gains the value.

### Patch Changes

- fac7472: **Derive an agent version with new data-block pins, with no code change.** An expert edits a prompt or settings block and publishes a new version of it; deriving an agent version is how that edit reaches the agent.
  
  - **`POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/versions`** `{ from, pins: { prompts?, settings? }, label?, projectId? }`:
    - The new version is `from` with the named pins swapped, everything else kept.
    - It's numbered the next free patch after the agent's highest version (versions never change).
    - It records `derivedFrom: { version, reason: 'edited', label?, by: 'user:<id>' }`.
    - Answers `201` with the new agent version.
    - Needs `publish` on the agent.
  - **Refusals** (`400 validation-failed`, naming each problem under `details.issues`):
    - a version published before pins;
    - a block the version doesn't already reference (adding one is a code change);
    - a block version that isn't published, is unregistered, is the wrong kind, or isn't model settings for the model-settings block;
    - swaps that change nothing.
    - Tool pins can't be swapped: they come from code.
    - An unknown version answers `404 agent-not-found`.
  - **Clients:**
    - TS: `client.agents.versions.derive(agentId, { from, pins, label })`.
    - Python: `client.agents.derive_version(agent_id, from_=..., pins=...)`.
    - CLI: `kindgi agents derive <agent-id> --from=<semver> --prompt=<block-id>=<version> --setting=<block-id>=<version> [--label=<text>]`. Repeat `--prompt` and `--setting` for several blocks.
  - **A taken number is never overwritten.** `POST /v1/agents` with a version that's already registered (a derived version may hold it) still answers `409 agent-already-registered`. It now names the next free version in the message and as `nextFreeVersion`: `… is already registered, and versions never change; publish it as 1.4.2, the next free version`.
  - **Deploys:** a deploy whose definition and pins match a derived version reuses it, reporting the deploy's own reason (`pins-changed`), not `edited`.
  - **`VersionDerivation`:** `reason` adds `'edited'`; new optional `label` and `by`.
- 26b2a23: **A flow version is pinned when it's published, as an agent version is.** `POST /v1/flows` pins each tool the flow runs to its latest active version: tool nodes, fanout branches, and nodes in loop bodies. It also pins each agent the flow runs at no named version (an agent node without `config.version`). The result is stored on the version as `pins` (`{tools, agents}`) with `pinsDigest`, and every run of that flow version uses those versions. A new tool or agent version reaches the flow only through a new flow version. An agent node with its own `config.version` keeps it.
  
  - **Refusals:** a tool or agent with no published version refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`, naming each).
  - **Deploys** pin flows after agents and follow the same rule as agents, from one shared code path. When pins change, the deploy registers the next free version with `derivedFrom`, and a redeploy is idempotent. So one tool change cascades through an agent into a flow within a single deploy, each derived once. The deployment's `contents.flows` names each flow's registered version (`DeployedVersion`), and `kindgi deploy` prints one line per renumbered flow.
  - **Unchanged:** a flow version published before pins binds the latest versions per run, as before.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/flow`: `FlowPins`, `flowPinsDigest()` and `flowRefs()`.
    - `@kindgi/types`: `VersionDerivation`.
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `PinChange.kind` adds `agent`, and `pinChanges()` takes any pin set. `withVersions(flow, { tools?, agents? })` (`@kindgi/flow`) runs a flow version with some blocks at other exact versions through the same pins: what a comparison or replay runs, with `pinsDigest` recomputed.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 1463b77: Approvals, conversations and provenance list by project, as runs do. `GET /v1/approvals`, `GET /v1/conversations` and `GET /v1/provenance` take `scopeKind=project|org` + `scopeId`: one project's records, or every project's in an org. A `scopeId` that isn't a UUID is `400 scope-invalid`. The records say their project:
  - an agent's approvals are enqueued in the turn's project (`HitlEnqueueInput.projectId`);
  - a conversation has `projectId`, set by the run that opens it or by `POST /v1/conversations`' new `projectId` (one of the tenant's projects, else `400 bad-input`; omitted, the tenant's Default project, as for a run); `agent_conversations` gets a nullable `project_id` (migration `0003`);
  - a provenance record's list row has `projectId`, which the emitter passes beside the signed document (`ProvenanceEmitBinding.emit(provenance, { projectId })`).
  
  `ListScope` (`@kindgi/types`) is the scope of each binding's list input. TypeScript client: `scope` on `approvals.list`, `conversations.list` and `provenance.query`, and `projectId` on `conversations.open`; the Python client takes `scope_kind` / `scope_id` and `project_id` (regenerated). Records from before this release have no project, so only a list without a scope shows them (nothing is backfilled).

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.

## 0.1.1

No changes in this release.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: Flows take plain string ids. `defineFlow`'s `FlowSpec` is now `Unbranded<Flow>`: an author writes `id: 'acme.triage-ticket'`, node `id: 'parse'`, edge `from: 'parse'` with no `as FlowId` / `as NodeId` / `as EdgeId` (and no cast on the whole object); branded ids still fit, and the validated `Flow` is branded. `@kindgi/types` exports `Unbranded<T>` (every branded string in `T` loosened to `string`, all the way down). `runs.start({ flow })` / `({ agent })` take a plain string too.
- aec851d: Outbound webhooks: endpoints that receive a signed `run.finished` event when a top-level run completes, fails or is cancelled.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - `WebhookEndpointBinding` (caller-plugged) and `/v1/webhook-endpoints`: create (the response carries the signing secret, once), list, get, update, `unregister`, `rotate-secret`, the delivery log (`/deliveries`, with a status filter), `redeliver`, and `test` (queues a `webhook.test` event).
    - Endpoint filter: `projectId`, `flowIds`, `includeDryRuns`. Child runs never produce `run.finished`.
    - Event bodies (`RunFinishedEvent`, `WebhookTestEvent`) carry the run's identity and outcome (`FinishedRun`), never its input or output. The OpenAPI document describes them under `webhooks`.
    - Error codes: `webhook-endpoint-not-found`, `webhook-delivery-not-found` (404), `webhook-url-refused` (400).
  - `@kindgi/crypto`: Standard Webhooks signatures (`v1`, HMAC-SHA256): `signWebhook`, `webhookHeaders`, `verifyWebhook` (timestamp tolerance, several signatures during a secret rotation, constant-time comparison) and `generateWebhookSecret` (`whsec_…`). Checked against the reference implementation both ways.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `client.webhookEndpoints`. The unused outbound shapes `Webhook`, `WebhookSpec`, `WebhookSecret`, `WebhookDelivery`, `WebhookVerifyResult` and the `WebhookId` / `WebhookDeliveryId` brands are replaced by the generated wire types and `WebhookEndpointId`; `SubscriptionSpec`'s webhook target is `{ kind: 'webhook', endpoint }`.
  - `@kindgi/types`: `WebhookEndpointId` and `WebhookEventId`. `WebhookId` is documented as what it is: the routable id of an inbound webhook trigger.
