# @kindgi/runtime

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 6bae409: An agent's turn names its agent. The run record of an agent run, and of the turn a flow's agent step starts, carries `agent`: the agent's id, the version that ran and the conversation (`RunAgentRef` in `@kindgi/runtime`, `Run.agent` on the wire, the `RunAgent` schema). `GET /v1/runs?agentId=` lists one agent's turns, at every version; it combines with the scope, `topLevel` and the cursor. The TypeScript client takes `runs.list({ agentId })`; the Python client `runs.list(agent_id=…)`. Turns that ran before this release don't name their agent: they have no `agent` and aren't listed by `agentId`.

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- a994217: An approval gate keeps its decision when the turn resumes. A turn that parked on a gate decided again on resume, from the policy and conversation as they were by then: a rule relaxed meanwhile skipped the gate, so a reviewer's reject was never read and the tool ran; a turn completed meanwhile changed the session gate's token, so the decision was ignored and the turn parked again.
  
  - `NodeContext.record(key, decide)` (`@kindgi/handler`): decide once per step. The first call journals `decide`'s result; when the step runs again after a wait, the call returns it without deciding again. The journal entry is `value.recorded`, derived into `DerivedRunState.recordedValues` (`@kindgi/runtime`, `recordedValueKey`).
  - `record` is a new required member of `NodeContext`: a test double that builds its own `NodeContext` adds it. A decision outlives a retry of the step as well as a wait; calls for one key at the same time share one decision; the first call returns the JSON the journal keeps, as a replay does.
  - `NodeContext.clockNow` replays as documented: when the step resumes after a wait, its calls return the times they read before, in call order. A retry after a failure reads the clock afresh.
  - The session and tool approval gates (`@kindgi/agents`) decide through `record`. A gate not yet reached follows the policy as it is now.
  - `resumeAgentTurn` reports a snapshot it couldn't read as `run-snapshot-unreadable` (resuming again may work), apart from `run-snapshot-missing`. Both are declared: `RunSnapshotError` in `InvokeAgentError`.
  
  Upgrading: a turn that parked on a gate under an earlier runtime has no recorded decision, so when this runtime resumes it, its gate decides once more from the current policy, as before.

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: `KernelError` gains `RunLeaseLostError` (`code: 'run-lease-lost'`): the executor no longer holds the run's lease, because another executor claimed the run after this one's lease expired. It stops without failing or finishing the run, and the lease holder decides what happens to it. `@kindgi/api` maps it to 409, like `run-already-terminal`.
- aec851d: A turn parked on a tool-call approval resumes where it parked.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Fix: `resumeAgentTurn` after a tool-call approval.** It used to fail with `model-invocation-failed` ("model-call invoked before setup completed"), because the steps that ran before the park kept their state in memory. The turn now rebuilds that state:
      - its environment (conversation, guardrails, tools, policies), routed to the provider and model the turn started on. If that provider or model is no longer registered or allowed, the resume fails with `capability-routing-failed`.
      - the messages the turn stored, its retrieved facts, and its usage, so budgets count the whole turn.
    - **No repeats.** The step that parked runs again. It reuses the assistant message and the results of calls that ran before the park, so no call runs twice and nothing is stored twice.
    - **Errors.** `run-journal-unavailable` when the run's journal can't be read.
    - **Not rebuilt: provenance.** Provenance recorded before the park isn't rebuilt; the resumed turn's record starts at the resume.
  - `@kindgi/runtime`:
    - `DerivedRunState.completedBodySteps`: the loop-body steps that completed, by `bodyStepKey(nodeId, loopContext)`. A runtime replaying a loop on resume hands those steps their journaled results instead of running them again.
    - `CompletedBodyStep` and `bodyStepKey`.
- aec851d: A runtime can keep a run's state in memory, and publish journal entries in batches.
  
  - `@kindgi/runtime`:
    - `createRunState()`, `applyJournalEntry(state, entry)` and `cloneRunState(state)`.
      - `deriveRunState(journal)` is the fold of the first two.
      - A runtime reads a run's journal once, then applies each entry it writes, instead of reading the journal again.
      - It dispatches against a clone, so a running step sees the run as it was when the step was dispatched.
    - `KernelEventBusBinding.publishMany?(tenantId, channel, docs)` (optional): publish entries that were written together, in one call. The runtime uses it when the binding has it, and `publish` for each entry otherwise.
  - `@kindgi/api`: `EventBusBinding.publishMany?` (optional). It works like `publish` for each doc, with consecutive `seq`s and one notification.
- aec851d: Runs return their output, record which run started them, and can be started without waiting.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - Run responses (`GET /v1/runs/:runId`, start, cancel, resume) include `output` once the run completed. Lists include it only with `?include=output`.
    - A child run carries `parentRunId` and `parentNodeId`. `GET /v1/runs` filters with `?parentRunId=` (a run's children) or `?topLevel=true`.
    - `POST /v1/runs` accepts `options.wait: false`: the binding returns the run id as soon as the run exists and the route answers `202`. The default still answers `201` once the run completes, fails or suspends. `InvokeAgentBindingInput` and `InvokeFlowBindingInput` gain `wait`.
    - `POST /v1/runs/:runId/resume` resumes the run through the host's run handler after completing the waitpoint; the run used to stay suspended. Waitpoint ids starting with `child:` are reserved for the runtime (`400`).
    - New status mappings: `flow-unbound`, `flow-runs-not-supported` and `flow-resume-not-supported` → `422`.
  - `@kindgi/runtime`:
    - `ParentRunRef`, and `parent` on `RunFlowInput` / `StartRunParams`.
    - `RunFlowInput.runId` adopts a `pending` row created by `startRun`.
    - `HandlerResolver` (`handlerResolver` on `RunFlowInput` / `ResumeRunInput`) binds handlers for child flows.
    - `KernelRunRecord.parentRunId` / `parentNodeId` / `parentScope`; `ListRunsInput.parent` and `topLevelOnly`.
    - `KernelRunRecord.output` is documented as the output value itself, not a storage envelope.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `Run.output`, `Run.parentRunId` / `parentNodeId`; `runs.list({ parentRunId, topLevel, includeOutput })`; `StartRunOptions.wait`.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: Messages and variable descriptions no longer point at internal components: `KINDGI_API_PORT` / `KINDGI_OPENFGA_API_URL` / `KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND` descriptions say what the runtime does; the `external` guardrail strategy's error says to register an execution strategy; the payload-version error reads "Unsupported payload version N (this reader handles version M)" — it was worded "newer than this reader" also for older versions.
