# @kindgi/runtime

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: `KernelError` gains `RunLeaseLostError` (`code: 'run-lease-lost'`): the executor no longer holds the run's lease, because another executor claimed the run after this one's lease expired. It stops without failing or finishing the run, and the lease holder decides what happens to it. `@kindgi/api` maps it to 409, like `run-already-terminal`.
- aec851d: A turn parked on a tool-call approval resumes where it parked.
  
  - `@kindgi/agents`:
    - **Fix: `resumeAgentTurn` after a tool-call approval.** It used to fail with `model-invocation-failed` ("model-call invoked before setup completed"), because the steps that ran before the park kept their state in memory. The turn now rebuilds that state:
      - its environment (conversation, guardrails, tools, policies), routed to the provider and model the turn started on. If that provider or model is no longer registered or allowed, the resume fails with `capability-routing-failed`.
      - the messages the turn stored, its retrieved facts, and its usage, so budgets count the whole turn.
    - **No repeats.** The step that parked runs again. It reuses the assistant message and the results of calls that ran before the park, so no call runs twice and nothing is stored twice.
    - **Errors.** `run-journal-unavailable` when the run's journal can't be read.
    - **Not rebuilt: provenance.** Provenance recorded before the park isn't rebuilt; the resumed turn's record starts at the resume.
  - `@kindgi/runtime`:
    - `DerivedRunState.completedBodySteps`: the loop-body steps that completed, by `bodyStepKey(nodeId, loopContext)`. A runtime replaying a loop on resume hands those steps their journaled results instead of running them again.
    - `CompletedBodyStep` and `bodyStepKey`.
- aec851d: A runtime can keep a run's state in memory, and publish journal entries in batches.
  
  - `@kindgi/runtime`:
    - `createRunState()`, `applyJournalEntry(state, entry)` and `cloneRunState(state)`.
      - `deriveRunState(journal)` is the fold of the first two.
      - A runtime reads a run's journal once, then applies each entry it writes, instead of reading the journal again.
      - It dispatches against a clone, so a running step sees the run as it was when the step was dispatched.
    - `KernelEventBusBinding.publishMany?(tenantId, channel, docs)` (optional): publish entries that were written together, in one call. The runtime uses it when the binding has it, and `publish` for each entry otherwise.
  - `@kindgi/api`: `EventBusBinding.publishMany?` (optional). It works like `publish` for each doc, with consecutive `seq`s and one notification.
- aec851d: Runs return their output, record which run started them, and can be started without waiting.
  
  - `@kindgi/api`:
    - Run responses (`GET /v1/runs/:runId`, start, cancel, resume) include `output` once the run completed. Lists include it only with `?include=output`.
    - A child run carries `parentRunId` and `parentNodeId`. `GET /v1/runs` filters with `?parentRunId=` (a run's children) or `?topLevel=true`.
    - `POST /v1/runs` accepts `options.wait: false`: the binding returns the run id as soon as the run exists and the route answers `202`. The default still answers `201` once the run completes, fails or suspends. `InvokeAgentBindingInput` and `InvokeFlowBindingInput` gain `wait`.
    - `POST /v1/runs/:runId/resume` resumes the run through the host's run handler after completing the waitpoint; the run used to stay suspended. Waitpoint ids starting with `child:` are reserved for the runtime (`400`).
    - New status mappings: `flow-unbound`, `flow-runs-not-supported` and `flow-resume-not-supported` → `422`.
  - `@kindgi/runtime`:
    - `ParentRunRef`, and `parent` on `RunFlowInput` / `StartRunParams`.
    - `RunFlowInput.runId` adopts a `pending` row created by `startRun`.
    - `HandlerResolver` (`handlerResolver` on `RunFlowInput` / `ResumeRunInput`) binds handlers for child flows.
    - `KernelRunRecord.parentRunId` / `parentNodeId` / `parentScope`; `ListRunsInput.parent` and `topLevelOnly`.
    - `KernelRunRecord.output` is documented as the output value itself, not a storage envelope.
  - `@kindgi/client`: `Run.output`, `Run.parentRunId` / `parentNodeId`; `runs.list({ parentRunId, topLevel, includeOutput })`; `StartRunOptions.wait`.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: Messages and variable descriptions no longer point at internal components: `KINDGI_API_PORT` / `KINDGI_OPENFGA_API_URL` / `KINDGI_SECRETS_BACKEND` descriptions say what the runtime does; the `external` guardrail strategy's error says to register an execution strategy; the payload-version error reads "Unsupported payload version N (this reader handles version M)" — it was worded "newer than this reader" also for older versions.
