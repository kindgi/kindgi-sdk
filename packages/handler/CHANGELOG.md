## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 8b60576: **A tool call's idempotency key.** A run's step can run more than once: resumed after an approval, retried after a failure, or run again when the runtime restarted while it ran. So a tool that changes something (a refund, an email, a payment) could do it twice, with no key to dedupe on. `ToolContext.idempotencyKey` is the same every time the same call runs, and different for every other call: pass it to the system you write to (an `Idempotency-Key` header, a client reference, a unique column), or look for it there first.
  
  - **What it is:** a version 5 UUID (RFC 9562) under a fixed namespace (`TOOL_IDEMPOTENCY_NAMESPACE`), over the run, the step and the tool, plus the model's call id for a call a model asked for (`toolIdempotencyKey`, `@kindgi/tools`). The pack protocol schema says how, so any runtime makes the same key.
  - **The step:** `NodeContext.stepScope` names a step the same every time it runs (its node, a loop body's step with its iteration, a fanout branch). A model's call id alone isn't enough: it's only unique within one of its answers, so two turns of a loop can share one.
  - **Every pack language:** the pack protocol's call context carries it (protocol 2.6.0; an older pack service ignores it). Python `ctx.idempotency_key`, Java and Scala `ctx.idempotencyKey()`. The conformance suite checks that each pack service hands it to the tool, and that a 0.1.1 service still answers a call carrying it.
  - **Absent** outside a run, and from a runtime that can't name its steps (before 0.1.6): the call can't be deduped on it then.
  - **The docs:** "Make a side effect happen once" in Write a tool, and the tools skills (every language). `requestId` is no longer described as an idempotency key.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- eac7732: A tool knows its run's project and org: `ToolContext.projectId` and `orgId` (Python: `project_id`, `org_id`), and a guardrail check's trace gets `orgId` (`org_id`) next to `projectId`. The runtime sets them from the run and its project, never from the run's input or a model's arguments, so a tool can compare an org or project id in its input with the run's own instead of trusting it. `orgId` is absent when the project has no org. They reach pack code in the call context: pack protocol 2.3.0 adds optional `projectId` and `orgId` to `callContext`. A pack service built with Kindgi 0.1.1 answers such calls as before (it checks only `v`, `tenantId` and `runId`); `@kindgi/pack-conformance` has a suite that proves it against the 0.1.1 releases (`describeCallContextCompatibility`). Also: `NodeContext.projectId` / `orgId` for the kernel, and `InvokeAgentInput.orgId` and `ResumeAgentTurnInput.orgId`, so a turn resumed after an approval keeps its org.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- a994217: An approval gate keeps its decision when the turn resumes. A turn that parked on a gate decided again on resume, from the policy and conversation as they were by then: a rule relaxed meanwhile skipped the gate, so a reviewer's reject was never read and the tool ran; a turn completed meanwhile changed the session gate's token, so the decision was ignored and the turn parked again.
  
  - `NodeContext.record(key, decide)` (`@kindgi/handler`): decide once per step. The first call journals `decide`'s result; when the step runs again after a wait, the call returns it without deciding again. The journal entry is `value.recorded`, derived into `DerivedRunState.recordedValues` (`@kindgi/runtime`, `recordedValueKey`).
  - `record` is a new required member of `NodeContext`: a test double that builds its own `NodeContext` adds it. A decision outlives a retry of the step as well as a wait; calls for one key at the same time share one decision; the first call returns the JSON the journal keeps, as a replay does.
  - `NodeContext.clockNow` replays as documented: when the step resumes after a wait, its calls return the times they read before, in call order. A retry after a failure reads the clock afresh.
  - The session and tool approval gates (`@kindgi/agents`) decide through `record`. A gate not yet reached follows the policy as it is now.
  - `resumeAgentTurn` reports a snapshot it couldn't read as `run-snapshot-unreadable` (resuming again may work), apart from `run-snapshot-missing`. Both are declared: `RunSnapshotError` in `InvokeAgentError`.
  
  Upgrading: a turn that parked on a gate under an earlier runtime has no recorded decision, so when this runtime resumes it, its gate decides once more from the current policy, as before.
