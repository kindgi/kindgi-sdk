# @kindgi/tools

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- bef2d8c: **A tool whose `needsSpec` schema wouldn't compile is refused up front.** Each schema in `needsSpec.secrets` and `needsSpec.env` must compile as the runtime compiles it when it loads the tool, and an env value's `default` must be a string. Before, a pack with one the runtime couldn't compile (an unknown keyword, say) deployed fine, and then the runtime left that tool out, so calls to it failed as an unknown tool. Now `defineTool` refuses it (`invalid-tool-definition`), and so do `POST /v1/tools` (`400 validation-failed`) and a deployment (`400 deployment-validation-failed`). The message names the tool, the slot and the name (`Tool "acme.sign": the schema for needsSpec.secrets.SIGNING_KEY doesn't compile: …`), and the issue's path is `/needsSpec/<slot>/<name>`.
- 85ef97c: **A tool's secret can be optional.** A secret declared in `needsSpec.secrets` with a schema that accepts `null` (`{ type: ['string', 'null'] }`) is optional. When the env doesn't have it, or has it empty, it's left out of `ctx.secrets` and the call goes on, with the call's log line naming it. A value that is set is still checked against the schema. A revoked secret, one whose value is gone at its provider though it's still mapped, or a secrets backend that fails, still fails the call. The schema has to name `null`: an unconstrained `{}` stays required. This needs runtime 0.1.6 or later: an older runtime requires every declared secret, failing a call without one with `secret-unavailable`. The guide ("An optional secret"), the authoring skills for every pack language, and the TypeScript and Python context types say so.
  
  `SecretError`'s `secret-not-found` (`@kindgi/api`) gains an optional `reason`: `deleted-at-provider` when the secret is mapped but its provider has no value for it. Absent means it was never stored.
- 307771f: A model provider's key is used by its provider only. A secret that a provider registration of the tenant names (its `secret_ref`, in any env) can't be declared or sent by a tool, or named by an MCP or a webhook endpoint:
  
  - **`POST /v1/tools`, `POST /v1/mcp/endpoints`, and `POST` or `PATCH /v1/webhook-endpoints`** refuse it with `400 provider-key-refused`, naming the secret and the provider (`details.secret`, `details.providerId`). The message says what to do: store the key under its own name (the same value is fine) and use that name.
  - **`POST /v1/deployments`** reports each tool that names one as a `deployment-validation-failed` issue (`path` `/secrets/<name>`), and deploys nothing.
  - **`POST /v1/providers`** refuses a `secret_ref` that a tool (its current version), an MCP endpoint or a webhook endpoint already uses: `409 provider-key-in-use`, with `details.usedBy` listing each.
  
  For a runtime to enforce the same at every call, `@kindgi/api` exports `guardProviderKeys(binding, keys, user)`: a `SecretBinding` whose `resolve` answers a model provider's key with the new `SecretError` code `provider-key-refused` (naming the secret and the provider), for whatever hands secrets to tools and endpoints, while the provider adapters keep the store itself. Also exported: `providerKeysOf(registry)`, `providerKeyRefusal`, `usersOfSecret`, and their types.
  
  `@kindgi/tools` exports `toolSecretNames(manifest)`: every secret a tool declares or sends, by name.
- 03151ca: **A union of types compiles.** A schema with `type: ['string', 'number', 'boolean', 'null']`, which is what Zod 4 writes for `z.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.boolean(), z.null()])`, used to be refused ("strict mode: use allowUnionTypes…"), while `.nullable()` compiled. It's standard JSON Schema, and every schema compiler now takes it: tool input and output, an agent's typed output, a guardrail check's config, flow and block schemas, and the pack service's validation. `ALLOW_UNION_TYPES` (`@kindgi/schema`) says so.
  - A schema that strict mode still refuses (an open tuple, an unknown keyword) says how out: for a field that may hold any JSON value, `z.json()` (or `{}` in JSON Schema) compiles.
  - The Java pack service validates a union of types too (its CHANGELOG). Python's always did.
- 8b60576: **A tool call's idempotency key.** A run's step can run more than once: resumed after an approval, retried after a failure, or run again when the runtime restarted while it ran. So a tool that changes something (a refund, an email, a payment) could do it twice, with no key to dedupe on. `ToolContext.idempotencyKey` is the same every time the same call runs, and different for every other call: pass it to the system you write to (an `Idempotency-Key` header, a client reference, a unique column), or look for it there first.
  
  - **What it is:** a version 5 UUID (RFC 9562) under a fixed namespace (`TOOL_IDEMPOTENCY_NAMESPACE`), over the run, the step and the tool, plus the model's call id for a call a model asked for (`toolIdempotencyKey`, `@kindgi/tools`). The pack protocol schema says how, so any runtime makes the same key.
  - **The step:** `NodeContext.stepScope` names a step the same every time it runs (its node, a loop body's step with its iteration, a fanout branch). A model's call id alone isn't enough: it's only unique within one of its answers, so two turns of a loop can share one.
  - **Every pack language:** the pack protocol's call context carries it (protocol 2.6.0; an older pack service ignores it). Python `ctx.idempotency_key`, Java and Scala `ctx.idempotencyKey()`. The conformance suite checks that each pack service hands it to the tool, and that a 0.1.1 service still answers a call carrying it.
  - **Absent** outside a run, and from a runtime that can't name its steps (before 0.1.6): the call can't be deduped on it then.
  - **The docs:** "Make a side effect happen once" in Write a tool, and the tools skills (every language). `requestId` is no longer described as an idempotency key.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 93ebe85: Agents can remember, under rules the model can't change.
  
  - **The declaration.** `defineAgent({ memory: { remember: { types: ['preference'], scope: 'same-user', keepDays: 30 } } })` gives the agent's turns the built-in tool `kindgi_remember`. The model picks the type (one of `types`), the text (up to 2,000 characters), an optional slot `key` and when it stops being true. It never picks the scope: `same-user` (the conversation's end user, else the user the run acts for), `same-conversation`, `same-project` or `tenant` come from the declaration and the run. Built-in tools are `kindgi_<verb>`, with no dots, so the model calls exactly the name the docs and instructions use, and the tool's description names it. The prefix is reserved: an agent can't list a built-in in `tools`, and publishing a tool whose id starts with `kindgi_` is refused (`BUILT_IN_TOOL_PREFIX` in `@kindgi/tools`).
  - **Every remembered fact** is `unverified`, attributed to the agent version (`attributedTo`) and to the run, step and tool call that wrote it (`generatedBy`). It expires after `keepDays` (default 30) unless a person verifies it. A new value for the same type and `key` replaces the one the same agent remembered before, as that fact's next revision. An agent never replaces another agent's fact or a person's.
  - **A person approves it first** when the scope is wider than one person (`same-project`, `tenant`), or the text reads like an instruction (always/never, ignore/disregard, "you must", a link, one of the agent's tools). Until then no read sees it, and the model is told it waits for review. Otherwise it's used at once.
  - **The tool dispatches like any other.** The agent's `hitl.tools` policy applies to it, a replay refuses it or uses the recording, and the tool error policy decides what a failed store does. `InvokeAgentBindings.memoryWriter` (`MemoryRememberBinding` in `@kindgi/memory`) is where the runtime stores it. On a host without one, a call answers that nothing was remembered, and publishing warns `remember-unavailable` (`MemoryBinding.agentRemember`).
  - **The `<memory>` block** now gives each fact the time it was recorded (`recordedAt`), and for a fact an agent remembered, which agent (`agent`). Two agents' values for the same slot both show, each with its agent and time; none is picked silently. **This changes what models see.**
  - **Provenance.**
    - Each retrieval intent is a `memory-read` node with `operation: search_memory`, holding what it searched and the ids it found. Each retrieved fact is `retrieved-from` its search and carries its ranks.
    - Each remembered fact is a `memory-write` node with `operation: create_memory` or `update_memory`, its actor the agent version, `produced` by the tool call.
    - These are the OpenTelemetry GenAI operation names, as an attribute on the existing node kinds, so no client sees a new enum value.
  - **`Fact.expiresAt`** (optional in the API): when a revision stops being readable. No read returns a fact after it. The runtime sets it from the fact's retention, or from an agent-remembered fact's unverified window.
  - **Specs.** The agent spec (schema-version 1.5.0) carries `memory.remember`. The pack index keeps it, as it keeps all of `memory`.
- 768ad8f: The TypeScript pack service writes `@kindgi/log` records on stderr (subsystem `pack`), the same schema as the runtime's: one record per call carrying the call's `tenantId`, `runId`, `requestId`, `toolId`, its outcome and duration, and the caller's `traceId` from the `traceparent` it sent. The lifecycle (`listening`, `boot-failed`, `config-invalid`, `draining`, `stopped`) is written whatever the levels; `KINDGI_LOG_LEVEL`, `KINDGI_LOG_LEVELS` and `KINDGI_LOG_FORMAT` apply to the rest (`auto` is JSON unless stderr is a terminal). The service's records keep `kind` beside `event`, so an older supervisor still reads them.
  
  `ctx.log` (an optional `ToolContext.log`): a logger bound to the call, so a tool's own records carry the run's ids and trace (`ctx.log.info('looked up order', { orderId })`, subsystem `pack.tool`). `kindgi dev` shows them as `[pack]` lines.
  
  The supervisor reads records and older bare events, acts only on the service's own lifecycle, and no longer swallows the pack's own JSON output that happens to have a `kind` field. It runs its child with `KINDGI_LOG_FORMAT=json`. `createPackService` takes `log`; its `logger` callback still gets the events.
- 81f46aa: **A replay sends a read-only tool the env values the past run's call saw.** A comparison that replays a run (a candidate agent version over a test set) runs some read-only tools live. Those tools now read the config the past run read, not today's, so an env value changed since then can't skew the judged deltas.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:** a judged run's copy keeps `context.toolEnv`, each tool's recorded env values by tool id. It's taken from an agent turn's calls and from a flow's tool steps, agent steps and sub-flows. It's optional in the spec, and a run from before env was recorded has none.
  - **`@kindgi/agents`:** a replay binding's `live` decision can carry `env`. The turn journals it with the decision, keeps it out of the replay report, and sends it as the call's `ctx.env`. Names it doesn't hold (a tool version that declares more) resolve as usual.
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:** `toolCallRecordKey` and `TOOL_ENV_RECORD_KEY` name where a call's `ToolContext.record` decisions are journaled, so dispatch sites and capture agree.
- 280377e: **A tool's env values, per project (`ctx.env`).** A tool that declares names in `needsSpec.env` gets their values in `ctx.env` on each call: the call's project's value, else its org's, else the tenant's, in the env the runtime serves (`KINDGI_ENV`). A schema `default` makes a name optional. The values a call used are recorded with it (`ToolContext.record`, new: the step's durable record, set by the dispatch site), so the call re-run after a wait or a retry sees the same ones. A runtime that resolves them is needed; with an older one, `ctx.env` stays absent.
  
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:** `ToolContext.env`; `ToolContext.record`, which an agent turn's tool dispatch (`@kindgi/agents`) sets to its step's record under `tool-call:<call id>:<tool id>:<key>`; and `TypedNeeds` documents what `env` and `secrets` take (strings, checked by their schema; `config` is reserved).
  - **Pack protocol 2.5.0** (`@kindgi/specs`, `@kindgi/handler-runtime`, the Python SDK): `callContext.env` holds the declared names' string values. It's additive: a pack service that predates it already passes it through.
  - **`kindgi env set/list/unset --scope=tenant|org:<id>|project:<id> --env=<name>`** act on the runtime's env values (`/v1/env`). Without `--scope` they edit the pack's local env files, as before. `--env` is required with `--scope`. `set` refuses to change a value without `--force`, and warns about a name that looks like a credential. A runtime that doesn't serve `/v1/env` gets a plain message.
  - `kindgi env`'s description now says what it manages. It used to say values "resolve into `needs.env` at deploy time", which nothing did.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 024a47f: **An agent's prompt and settings can come from data blocks, pinned when the agent version is published.**
  
  - **References:**
    - `instructions` is the system prompt, or a prompt block by range: `{ prompt: 'acme.intake-prompt', version: '^1.0.0' }`. Its template and declared parameters are used instead.
    - `settings: [{ id, version }]` lists settings blocks.
    - `modelSettings: { id, version }` names a model-settings block (`MODEL_SETTINGS_SCHEMA`: `temperature`, `maxOutputTokens`).
  - **Pinned at publish:** `POST /v1/agents` and deploys resolve each reference by `pickVersion` into `pins.prompts` / `pins.settings`, alongside the tools.
  - **Refusals:** a reference that matches no published version, names a block of the other kind, names model settings that aren't, or runs on a runtime with no block registry refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`).
  - **At run time:** a turn loads each block at its pinned version. A resumed turn uses the versions its `setup` journaled (`blockVersions`).
    - The prompt block renders as the instructions.
    - Settings values reach tools as `ToolContext.settings['<id>']` and templates as `settings["<id>"]`.
    - Model settings go into the model call.
    - A block that can't load fails the turn (`block-unresolvable`).
    - `InvokeAgentBindings` takes an optional `blockReader`.
  - **Changed elsewhere:** the agent spec, the pack index, both indexers (TS and Python: `Agent(instructions={...}, settings=[...], model_settings={...})`), and both clients.
  - **Pack protocol 2.4.0:** `callContext` gets optional `settings`, so pack code reads them: `ctx.settings['acme.weights']` in TS, `ctx.settings["acme.weights"]` in Python. Older pack services still answer calls that carry it: a TS one passes it to the handler, a Python one drops it.
  - **`settings` is now a reserved template name.**
- fa6680c: **A deploy pins its agents and never keeps a version's old pins.** `POST /v1/deployments` pins each agent as `POST /v1/agents` does. A deploy registers an agent under the version its definition names. When that version is already registered with other pins or content (versions never change), the deploy registers the next free version in its line instead (`1.4.0` → `1.4.1`, `1.4.0-rc.1` → `1.4.0-rc.2`). A deploy never refuses a routine deploy over this.
  
  - **Why a new version:**
    - `pins-changed`: a tool the agent uses has a new version in range.
    - `unpinned`: the version was published before pins existed.
    - `version-taken`: the number is registered with another definition.
  - **Redeploys are idempotent.** A redeploy finds the version an earlier deploy registered for the same definition and pins.
  - **The record:**
    - The registered version records `derivedFrom: {version, reason}`.
    - The deployment's `contents.agents` names each agent's registered `version`. Where it differs from the definition's, it also gives `authoredVersion`, `reason`, `newVersion` and `pinChanges`.
  - **`kindgi deploy` prints one line per such agent:** `agent acme.matcher: registered new version 1.4.1 (1.4.0's pins changed: tool acme.score 1.0.0 → 1.1.0); set version: '1.4.1' in acme.matcher to match`.
  - **A range that matches no published version refuses the deploy:** `400 validation-failed`, with one issue per tool (`/agents/<i>/tools/<j>/version`), and the deploy's tools are rolled back.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `pinChanges()` and the `AgentDerivation` and `PinChange` types.
    - `@kindgi/tools`: `nextVersion()`.
- 8b28a25: **`pickVersion` and `latestVersion`: one rule for picking a version from a range.** `@kindgi/tools` now exports the rule the tool registry uses when a turn resolves an agent's tool ranges. A range picks the highest version it allows. A prerelease is picked only when the range names one, as in npm. With no range, the pick is the latest version. Other places that turn a range into a version use the same rule: the runtime's registries, `kindgi dev`, and (next) the versions an agent version pins when it's published. So a pin is always the version a run would have picked. `createToolRegistry`'s `resolve` behaves as before.
- 62608e3: **Unregister stops a version being chosen, not the pins that hold it.**
  
  - **Retired tool versions.** `createToolRegistry().register(tool, { retired: true })` keeps an unregistered tool version for the published agent and flow versions that pin it.
    - Only its exact version (`getVersion`, `hasVersion`) reaches it.
    - `resolve` (a range), `get` (latest), `list`, `versions`, `has` and `ids` skip it.
  - **A pinned turn reaches it.** A turn resolves a pinned tool by its exact version, so a published agent version pinned to a retired tool version keeps running it. A range never picks one.
  - **`getVersion` reads unregistered versions.** `AgentRegistryBinding.getVersion` and `FlowRegistryBinding.getVersion` return them too (`AgentVersionRecord`, `FlowVersionRecord`, with `unregisteredAt`). `GET /v1/agents/:id/versions/:version` and `GET /v1/flows/:id/versions/:version` return `unregisteredAt`.
  - **Who reads what:** a resumed run, provenance, and a flow version that pins an agent version read unregistered versions. A new run that names one is refused by the runtime.

    - Settings values reach tools as `ToolContext.settings['<id>']` and templates as `settings["<id>"]`.
    - Model settings go into the model call.
    - A block that can't load fails the turn (`block-unresolvable`).
    - `InvokeAgentBindings` takes an optional `blockReader`.
  - **Changed elsewhere:** the agent spec, the pack index, both indexers (TS and Python: `Agent(instructions={...}, settings=[...], model_settings={...})`), and both clients.
  - **Pack protocol 2.4.0:** `callContext` gets optional `settings`, so pack code reads them: `ctx.settings['acme.weights']` in TS, `ctx.settings["acme.weights"]` in Python. Older pack services still answer calls that carry it: a TS one passes it to the handler, a Python one drops it.
  - **`settings` is now a reserved template name.**
- fa6680c: **A deploy pins its agents and never keeps a version's old pins.** `POST /v1/deployments` pins each agent as `POST /v1/agents` does. A deploy registers an agent under the version its definition names. When that version is already registered with other pins or content (versions never change), the deploy registers the next free version in its line instead (`1.4.0` → `1.4.1`, `1.4.0-rc.1` → `1.4.0-rc.2`). A deploy never refuses a routine deploy over this.
  
  - **Why a new version:**
    - `pins-changed`: a tool the agent uses has a new version in range.
    - `unpinned`: the version was published before pins existed.
    - `version-taken`: the number is registered with another definition.
  - **Redeploys are idempotent.** A redeploy finds the version an earlier deploy registered for the same definition and pins.
  - **The record:**
    - The registered version records `derivedFrom: {version, reason}`.
    - The deployment's `contents.agents` names each agent's registered `version`. Where it differs from the definition's, it also gives `authoredVersion`, `reason`, `newVersion` and `pinChanges`.
  - **`kindgi deploy` prints one line per such agent:** `agent acme.matcher: registered new version 1.4.1 (1.4.0's pins changed: tool acme.score 1.0.0 → 1.1.0); set version: '1.4.1' in acme.matcher to match`.
  - **A range that matches no published version refuses the deploy:** `400 validation-failed`, with one issue per tool (`/agents/<i>/tools/<j>/version`), and the deploy's tools are rolled back.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `pinChanges()` and the `AgentDerivation` and `PinChange` types.
    - `@kindgi/tools`: `nextVersion()`.
- 8b28a25: **`pickVersion` and `latestVersion`: one rule for picking a version from a range.** `@kindgi/tools` now exports the rule the tool registry uses when a turn resolves an agent's tool ranges. A range picks the highest version it allows. A prerelease is picked only when the range names one, as in npm. With no range, the pick is the latest version. Other places that turn a range into a version use the same rule: the runtime's registries, `kindgi dev`, and (next) the versions an agent version pins when it's published. So a pin is always the version a run would have picked. `createToolRegistry`'s `resolve` behaves as before.
- 62608e3: **Unregister stops a version being chosen, not the pins that hold it.**
  
  - **Retired tool versions.** `createToolRegistry().register(tool, { retired: true })` keeps an unregistered tool version for the published agent and flow versions that pin it.
    - Only its exact version (`getVersion`, `hasVersion`) reaches it.
    - `resolve` (a range), `get` (latest), `list`, `versions`, `has` and `ids` skip it.
  - **A pinned turn reaches it.** A turn resolves a pinned tool by its exact version, so a published agent version pinned to a retired tool version keeps running it. A range never picks one.
  - **`getVersion` reads unregistered versions.** `AgentRegistryBinding.getVersion` and `FlowRegistryBinding.getVersion` return them too (`AgentVersionRecord`, `FlowVersionRecord`, with `unregisteredAt`). `GET /v1/agents/:id/versions/:version` and `GET /v1/flows/:id/versions/:version` return `unregisteredAt`.
  - **Who reads what:** a resumed run, provenance, and a flow version that pins an agent version read unregistered versions. A new run that names one is refused by the runtime.

### Patch Changes

- eac7732: A tool knows its run's project and org: `ToolContext.projectId` and `orgId` (Python: `project_id`, `org_id`), and a guardrail check's trace gets `orgId` (`org_id`) next to `projectId`. The runtime sets them from the run and its project, never from the run's input or a model's arguments, so a tool can compare an org or project id in its input with the run's own instead of trusting it. `orgId` is absent when the project has no org. They reach pack code in the call context: pack protocol 2.3.0 adds optional `projectId` and `orgId` to `callContext`. A pack service built with Kindgi 0.1.1 answers such calls as before (it checks only `v`, `tenantId` and `runId`); `@kindgi/pack-conformance` has a suite that proves it against the 0.1.1 releases (`describeCallContextCompatibility`). Also: `NodeContext.projectId` / `orgId` for the kernel, and `InvokeAgentInput.orgId` and `ResumeAgentTurnInput.orgId`, so a turn resumed after an approval keeps its org.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- 89a14b6: Tools from MCP servers built with the TypeScript MCP SDK are no longer skipped. Their schemas declare JSON Schema draft-07 (`"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"`), and every tool schema compiled as Draft 2020-12 only, so each one failed with `no schema with key or ref "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"`. An MCP tool's schemas (`transport: 'mcp'`) now compile in the dialect they declare: draft-06, draft-07, 2019-09 or 2020-12 (the default when they declare none), each with its own semantics (a draft-07 array-form `items` is a tuple), and without Ajv's strict mode, a lint for the schemas a pack writes: a server's union `type`s, open tuples and extension keywords are valid JSON Schema. Another dialect is refused, naming it. A pack's own tools are unchanged: Draft 2020-12, in strict mode; one declaring another dialect is refused with a message that says so. `@kindgi/schema` exports the compiler as `compileJsonSchema` (with `dialects` and `strict` options), and `jsonSchemaDialect`. `tool.schema.json`'s `input` and `output` descriptions say which dialects a tool's schemas may be in.

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: The hooks the runtime needs to guard the server's connections to hosts a tenant chose (T83). The guard itself is in the runtime.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:** `HostReach` gains `'metadata-network'` (link-local addresses, where the cloud metadata endpoints hand out the server's credentials) and `'loopback'` (the server's own host). `KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS=deployed` refuses both, as well as `'exec'`.
  - **`@kindgi/capabilities`:** `AdapterFactoryInput.fetch` is the fetch for a provider endpoint the registration chose.
  - **`@kindgi/adapter-model-openai-compat`:** the factory sends through that fetch.
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:**
    - `defineTool(spec, { synthesizer: { fetch } })` and `ToolSpecSynthesizerOptions`: a declarative HTTP tool's handler sends through the runtime's fetch.
    - `validateToolManifest` now refuses an HTTP tool whose `urlTemplate` puts a `{placeholder}` in the scheme, host or port, or isn't `http(s)://` with a host. Placeholders belong in the path and query, where they're URL-encoded; in the authority, a run's input would pick the host.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS`'s description says what `deployed` refuses.
- aec851d: `ToolContext.secrets`: the secrets a tool declares in `needsSpec.secrets`, resolved by the runtime for the call's tenant, are typed on the handler's context, so a TypeScript pack tool reads `ctx.secrets?.NAME` without a cast. The `kindgi-authoring-tools` skill says how to declare and read them, and that the runtime resolves an HTTP tool's `secretRef` itself.
- aec851d: `precondition-failed`: a runtime that refuses to run a tool — a secret the tool declares couldn't be resolved, say — throws `ToolPreconditionError(reason, message)` from its handler wrapper, and `invokeTool` reports `{ code: 'precondition-failed', reason }` instead of `handler-error … handler threw`, since the tool's code never ran. `isToolPreconditionError` recognizes one from any copy of the package.
- aec851d: A pack service to run a pack's code over HTTP (pack protocol v2), and tools learn which run they belong to.
  
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`:
    - New `./protocol` (v2): tool and check requests name the tool or check by id, and responses are `result`, `check-result` or `error` messages with typed codes (including `tool-not-in-pack`, `tool-version-mismatch`, `deadline-exceeded` and `cancelled`).
    - New `./pack-service`: `createPackService` and `startPackService` expose `POST /v1/invoke`, `GET /v1/info`, `/healthz` and `/readyz`, with token auth, a concurrency cap, a body limit, deadlines, cancellation on disconnect, prewarm and drain.
    - New `./pack-service-main`: the process entry (`KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `KINDGI_PACK_INDEX`, `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, `PORT`; SIGTERM drains).
    - `HandlerContext.abortSignal` (in-process calls only) lets handlers stop on cancel or deadline.
    - The v1 worker, controller and invokers are unchanged.
  - `@kindgi/tools`: `ToolContext.runId`, the kernel run a call belongs to. `requestId` stays the individual call's id.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: agent tool calls set `runId` to the turn's kernel run. They used to pass only the model's call id.
- aec851d: Tool lookups are bound to one tenant: `ToolRegistry.forTenant(tenantId)` replaces `hydrate`.
  
  - `@kindgi/tools`: `ToolRegistry.hydrate?(tenantId): Promise<void>` is replaced by a required `forTenant(tenantId): Promise<ToolRegistry>` that returns a registry answering for that tenant only. With `hydrate` followed by the tenant-less `resolve`, a multi-tenant implementation had to keep a shared "current tenant", so two tenants' concurrent agent turns could resolve each other's tools. `createToolRegistry` (single-tenant) returns itself; `invalidate(tenantId)` is unchanged. Implementations must add `forTenant` (breaking for custom `ToolRegistry` implementations).
  - `@kindgi/agents`: each turn resolves its tools through `toolRegistry.forTenant(tenantId)` (`resolveTurnTools`).
- aec851d: Tool inputs get their Zod defaults, transforms and refinements.
  
  - `@kindgi/schema`:
    - `toJSONSchema(schema, io)` and `toJSONSchemaSync(schema, converter, io)` take a required `io` (`SchemaIo`, `'input'` or `'output'`). The two sides differ exactly where Zod defaults: on the input side a `.default()` field is optional, on the output side it is required. Before, every conversion produced the output side.
    - `parseWithSchema(schema, value)` parses through a Zod schema's Standard Schema interface: defaults, transforms and refinements applied, or the issues.
  - `@kindgi/tools`:
    - A tool's advertised input schema is the input side, so a model may leave a defaulted field out.
    - `invokeTool` validates a copy of the input, filling in JSON Schema `default`s. A Zod-authored tool's input is then parsed with `inputZod`, so the handler gets its parsed input. A failed refinement is `input-validation-failed`, with the field's path.
    - A handler's input type defaults to `InferOutput` of the input schema, the parsed type.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: `runWorker`, which the pack service runs tools through, prepares the input the same way. The indexer converts tool inputs and guardrail config on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: a check's config schema converts on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: a typed agent's output schema converts on the output side, so downstream steps can rely on every field.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the tools skill explains what a handler receives.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: JSON Schema descriptions (51, across 12 schemas and their bundled copies) now match the code and stay inside this repository: neutral examples (`acme.*`), no vendor names the code doesn't target, "the Kindgi runtime" instead of "the OS", no roadmap notes, and corrected claims (tool `needs` are declarative, `capability-unsatisfiable` happens at routing time, `step.cancelled` wording, SSE `eventId`). `Capability.budget` and `Guardrail.budget` are documented as declarative — not enforced by the runtime — in the schemas and the TypeScript types. Only `description` values changed; keys, types, enums and `$comment` schema versions are unchanged.
