### Patch Changes

- 024a47f: **An agent's prompt and settings can come from data blocks, pinned when the agent version is published.**
  
  - **References:**
    - `instructions` is the system prompt, or a prompt block by range: `{ prompt: 'acme.intake-prompt', version: '^1.0.0' }`. Its template and declared parameters are used instead.
    - `settings: [{ id, version }]` lists settings blocks.
    - `modelSettings: { id, version }` names a model-settings block (`MODEL_SETTINGS_SCHEMA`: `temperature`, `maxOutputTokens`).
  - **Pinned at publish:** `POST /v1/agents` and deploys resolve each reference by `pickVersion` into `pins.prompts` / `pins.settings`, alongside the tools.
  - **Refusals:** a reference that matches no published version, names a block of the other kind, names model settings that aren't, or runs on a runtime with no block registry refuses the publish (`400 validation-failed`).
  - **At run time:** a turn loads each block at its pinned version. A resumed turn uses the versions its `setup` journaled (`blockVersions`).
    - The prompt block renders as the instructions.
    - Settings values reach tools as `ToolContext.settings['<id>']` and templates as `settings["<id>"]`.
    - Model settings go into the model call.
    - A block that can't load fails the turn (`block-unresolvable`).
    - `InvokeAgentBindings` takes an optional `blockReader`.
  - **Changed elsewhere:** the agent spec, the pack index, both indexers (TS and Python: `Agent(instructions={...}, settings=[...], model_settings={...})`), and both clients.
  - **Pack protocol 2.4.0:** `callContext` gets optional `settings`, so pack code reads them: `ctx.settings['acme.weights']` in TS, `ctx.settings["acme.weights"]` in Python. Older pack services still answer calls that carry it: a TS one passes it to the handler, a Python one drops it.
  - **`settings` is now a reserved template name.**
- fa6680c: **A deploy pins its agents and never keeps a version's old pins.** `POST /v1/deployments` pins each agent as `POST /v1/agents` does. A deploy registers an agent under the version its definition names. When that version is already registered with other pins or content (versions never change), the deploy registers the next free version in its line instead (`1.4.0` → `1.4.1`, `1.4.0-rc.1` → `1.4.0-rc.2`). A deploy never refuses a routine deploy over this.
  
  - **Why a new version:**
    - `pins-changed`: a tool the agent uses has a new version in range.
    - `unpinned`: the version was published before pins existed.
    - `version-taken`: the number is registered with another definition.
  - **Redeploys are idempotent.** A redeploy finds the version an earlier deploy registered for the same definition and pins.
  - **The record:**
    - The registered version records `derivedFrom: {version, reason}`.
    - The deployment's `contents.agents` names each agent's registered `version`. Where it differs from the definition's, it also gives `authoredVersion`, `reason`, `newVersion` and `pinChanges`.
  - **`kindgi deploy` prints one line per such agent:** `agent acme.matcher: registered new version 1.4.1 (1.4.0's pins changed: tool acme.score 1.0.0 → 1.1.0); set version: '1.4.1' in acme.matcher to match`.
  - **A range that matches no published version refuses the deploy:** `400 validation-failed`, with one issue per tool (`/agents/<i>/tools/<j>/version`), and the deploy's tools are rolled back.
  - **New exports:**
    - `@kindgi/agents`: `pinChanges()` and the `AgentDerivation` and `PinChange` types.
    - `@kindgi/tools`: `nextVersion()`.
- 8b28a25: **`pickVersion` and `latestVersion`: one rule for picking a version from a range.** `@kindgi/tools` now exports the rule the tool registry uses when a turn resolves an agent's tool ranges. A range picks the highest version it allows. A prerelease is picked only when the range names one, as in npm. With no range, the pick is the latest version. Other places that turn a range into a version use the same rule: the runtime's registries, `kindgi dev`, and (next) the versions an agent version pins when it's published. So a pin is always the version a run would have picked. `createToolRegistry`'s `resolve` behaves as before.
- 62608e3: **Unregister stops a version being chosen, not the pins that hold it.**
  
  - **Retired tool versions.** `createToolRegistry().register(tool, { retired: true })` keeps an unregistered tool version for the published agent and flow versions that pin it.
    - Only its exact version (`getVersion`, `hasVersion`) reaches it.
    - `resolve` (a range), `get` (latest), `list`, `versions`, `has` and `ids` skip it.
  - **A pinned turn reaches it.** A turn resolves a pinned tool by its exact version, so a published agent version pinned to a retired tool version keeps running it. A range never picks one.
  - **`getVersion` reads unregistered versions.** `AgentRegistryBinding.getVersion` and `FlowRegistryBinding.getVersion` return them too (`AgentVersionRecord`, `FlowVersionRecord`, with `unregisteredAt`). `GET /v1/agents/:id/versions/:version` and `GET /v1/flows/:id/versions/:version` return `unregisteredAt`.
  - **Who reads what:** a resumed run, provenance, and a flow version that pins an agent version read unregistered versions. A new run that names one is refused by the runtime.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- eac7732: A tool knows its run's project and org: `ToolContext.projectId` and `orgId` (Python: `project_id`, `org_id`), and a guardrail check's trace gets `orgId` (`org_id`) next to `projectId`. The runtime sets them from the run and its project, never from the run's input or a model's arguments, so a tool can compare an org or project id in its input with the run's own instead of trusting it. `orgId` is absent when the project has no org. They reach pack code in the call context: pack protocol 2.3.0 adds optional `projectId` and `orgId` to `callContext`. A pack service built with Kindgi 0.1.1 answers such calls as before (it checks only `v`, `tenantId` and `runId`); `@kindgi/pack-conformance` has a suite that proves it against the 0.1.1 releases (`describeCallContextCompatibility`). Also: `NodeContext.projectId` / `orgId` for the kernel, and `InvokeAgentInput.orgId` and `ResumeAgentTurnInput.orgId`, so a turn resumed after an approval keeps its org.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 966a615: CommonJS apps can `require()` Kindgi. Every package's `exports` gives a `default` condition beside `import`, so `require('@kindgi/sdk/client')` loads the ES modules through Node's `require()` of ES modules, instead of failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. There's still one copy of each module, so the same code runs from either kind of app.
  
  - Node 22.12 or later: every package's `engines.node` is `>=22.12.0` (Node loads ES modules with `require()` from 22.12 on), and so are the apps `kindgi init` creates.
  - TypeScript that compiles to CommonJS needs TypeScript 5.8 or later with `module: nodenext`, or `moduleResolution: bundler` in an app a bundler builds.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`'s program entries (`pack-service-main`, `kindgi-index-main`) stay ES-modules-only: they run with `node`.
- 89a14b6: Tools from MCP servers built with the TypeScript MCP SDK are no longer skipped. Their schemas declare JSON Schema draft-07 (`"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"`), and every tool schema compiled as Draft 2020-12 only, so each one failed with `no schema with key or ref "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"`. An MCP tool's schemas (`transport: 'mcp'`) now compile in the dialect they declare: draft-06, draft-07, 2019-09 or 2020-12 (the default when they declare none), each with its own semantics (a draft-07 array-form `items` is a tuple), and without Ajv's strict mode, a lint for the schemas a pack writes: a server's union `type`s, open tuples and extension keywords are valid JSON Schema. Another dialect is refused, naming it. A pack's own tools are unchanged: Draft 2020-12, in strict mode; one declaring another dialect is refused with a message that says so. `@kindgi/schema` exports the compiler as `compileJsonSchema` (with `dialects` and `strict` options), and `jsonSchemaDialect`. `tool.schema.json`'s `input` and `output` descriptions say which dialects a tool's schemas may be in.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- aec851d: The hooks the runtime needs to guard the server's connections to hosts a tenant chose (T83). The guard itself is in the runtime.
  
  - **`@kindgi/api`:** `HostReach` gains `'metadata-network'` (link-local addresses, where the cloud metadata endpoints hand out the server's credentials) and `'loopback'` (the server's own host). `KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS=deployed` refuses both, as well as `'exec'`.
  - **`@kindgi/capabilities`:** `AdapterFactoryInput.fetch` is the fetch for a provider endpoint the registration chose.
  - **`@kindgi/adapter-model-openai-compat`:** the factory sends through that fetch.
  - **`@kindgi/tools`:**
    - `defineTool(spec, { synthesizer: { fetch } })` and `ToolSpecSynthesizerOptions`: a declarative HTTP tool's handler sends through the runtime's fetch.
    - `validateToolManifest` now refuses an HTTP tool whose `urlTemplate` puts a `{placeholder}` in the scheme, host or port, or isn't `http(s)://` with a host. Placeholders belong in the path and query, where they're URL-encoded; in the authority, a run's input would pick the host.
  - **`@kindgi/env-schema`:** `KINDGI_TENANT_HOST_ACCESS`'s description says what `deployed` refuses.
- aec851d: `ToolContext.secrets`: the secrets a tool declares in `needsSpec.secrets`, resolved by the runtime for the call's tenant, are typed on the handler's context, so a TypeScript pack tool reads `ctx.secrets?.NAME` without a cast. The `kindgi-authoring-tools` skill says how to declare and read them, and that the runtime resolves an HTTP tool's `secretRef` itself.
- aec851d: `precondition-failed`: a runtime that refuses to run a tool — a secret the tool declares couldn't be resolved, say — throws `ToolPreconditionError(reason, message)` from its handler wrapper, and `invokeTool` reports `{ code: 'precondition-failed', reason }` instead of `handler-error … handler threw`, since the tool's code never ran. `isToolPreconditionError` recognizes one from any copy of the package.
- aec851d: A pack service to run a pack's code over HTTP (pack protocol v2), and tools learn which run they belong to.
  
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`:
    - New `./protocol` (v2): tool and check requests name the tool or check by id, and responses are `result`, `check-result` or `error` messages with typed codes (including `tool-not-in-pack`, `tool-version-mismatch`, `deadline-exceeded` and `cancelled`).
    - New `./pack-service`: `createPackService` and `startPackService` expose `POST /v1/invoke`, `GET /v1/info`, `/healthz` and `/readyz`, with token auth, a concurrency cap, a body limit, deadlines, cancellation on disconnect, prewarm and drain.
    - New `./pack-service-main`: the process entry (`KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `KINDGI_PACK_INDEX`, `KINDGI_PACK_SERVICE_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, `PORT`; SIGTERM drains).
    - `HandlerContext.abortSignal` (in-process calls only) lets handlers stop on cancel or deadline.
    - The v1 worker, controller and invokers are unchanged.
  - `@kindgi/tools`: `ToolContext.runId`, the kernel run a call belongs to. `requestId` stays the individual call's id.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: agent tool calls set `runId` to the turn's kernel run. They used to pass only the model's call id.
- aec851d: Tool lookups are bound to one tenant: `ToolRegistry.forTenant(tenantId)` replaces `hydrate`.
  
  - `@kindgi/tools`: `ToolRegistry.hydrate?(tenantId): Promise<void>` is replaced by a required `forTenant(tenantId): Promise<ToolRegistry>` that returns a registry answering for that tenant only. With `hydrate` followed by the tenant-less `resolve`, a multi-tenant implementation had to keep a shared "current tenant", so two tenants' concurrent agent turns could resolve each other's tools. `createToolRegistry` (single-tenant) returns itself; `invalidate(tenantId)` is unchanged. Implementations must add `forTenant` (breaking for custom `ToolRegistry` implementations).
  - `@kindgi/agents`: each turn resolves its tools through `toolRegistry.forTenant(tenantId)` (`resolveTurnTools`).
- aec851d: Tool inputs get their Zod defaults, transforms and refinements.
  
  - `@kindgi/schema`:
    - `toJSONSchema(schema, io)` and `toJSONSchemaSync(schema, converter, io)` take a required `io` (`SchemaIo`, `'input'` or `'output'`). The two sides differ exactly where Zod defaults: on the input side a `.default()` field is optional, on the output side it is required. Before, every conversion produced the output side.
    - `parseWithSchema(schema, value)` parses through a Zod schema's Standard Schema interface: defaults, transforms and refinements applied, or the issues.
  - `@kindgi/tools`:
    - A tool's advertised input schema is the input side, so a model may leave a defaulted field out.
    - `invokeTool` validates a copy of the input, filling in JSON Schema `default`s. A Zod-authored tool's input is then parsed with `inputZod`, so the handler gets its parsed input. A failed refinement is `input-validation-failed`, with the field's path.
    - A handler's input type defaults to `InferOutput` of the input schema, the parsed type.
  - `@kindgi/handler-runtime`: `runWorker`, which the pack service runs tools through, prepares the input the same way. The indexer converts tool inputs and guardrail config on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/guardrails`: a check's config schema converts on the input side.
  - `@kindgi/agents`: a typed agent's output schema converts on the output side, so downstream steps can rely on every field.
  - `@kindgi/sdk`: the tools skill explains what a handler receives.

### Patch Changes

- aec851d: JSON Schema descriptions (51, across 12 schemas and their bundled copies) now match the code and stay inside this repository: neutral examples (`acme.*`), no vendor names the code doesn't target, "the Kindgi runtime" instead of "the OS", no roadmap notes, and corrected claims (tool `needs` are declarative, `capability-unsatisfiable` happens at routing time, `step.cancelled` wording, SSE `eventId`). `Capability.budget` and `Guardrail.budget` are documented as declarative — not enforced by the runtime — in the schemas and the TypeScript types. Only `description` values changed; keys, types, enums and `$comment` schema versions are unchanged.
